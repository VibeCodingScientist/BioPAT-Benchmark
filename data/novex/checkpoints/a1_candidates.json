    "title": "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B Antagonizes Signalling by Oncoprotein Tyrosine Kinase p210 bcr-abl In Vivo",
    "abstract": "The p210 bcr-abl protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) appears to be directly responsible for the initial manifestations of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In contrast to the extensive characterization of the PTK and its effects on cell function, relatively little is known about the nature of the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that may modulate p210 bcr-abl-induced signalling. In this study, we have demonstrated that expression of PTP1B is enhanced specifically in various cells expressing p210 bcr-abl, including a cell line derived from a patient with CML. This effect on expression of PTP1B required the kinase activity of p210 bcr-abl and occurred rapidly, concomitant with maximal activation of a temperature-sensitive mutant of the PTK. The effect is apparently specific for PTP1B since, among several PTPs tested, we detected no change in the levels of TCPTP, the closest relative of PTP1B. We have developed a strategy for identification of physiological substrates of individual PTPs which utilizes substrate-trapping mutant forms of the enzymes that retain the ability to bind to substrate but fail to catalyze efficient dephosphorylation. We have observed association between a substrate-trapping mutant of PTP1B (PTP1B-D181A) and p210 bcr-abl, but not v-Abl, in a cellular context. Consistent with the trapping data, we observed dephosphorylation of p210 bcr-abl, but not v-Abl, by PTP1B in vivo. We have demonstrated that PTP1B inhibited binding of the adapter protein Grb2 to p210 bcr-abl and suppressed p210 bcr-abl-induced transcriptional activation that is dependent on Ras. These results illustrate selectivity in the effects of PTPs in a cellular context and suggest that PTP1B may function as a specific, negative regulator of p210 bcr-abl signalling in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Cocaine abuse causes cardiac dysfunction. Acute intravenous administration of cocaine may lead to development of severe arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, ST-T changes, and sudden death. Understanding arrhythmogenesis due to cocaine may provide a therapeutic approach to reduce morbidity and mortality. We studied the arrhythmogenic activity and other electrocardiographic abnormalities resulting from an intravenous bolus of cocaine. Baseline and postanesthetic electrocardiographic findings were compared with those after administration of intravenous bolus of various doses of cocaine hydrochloride in 20 dogs. The study was done in three phases (phase I: low dose of cocaine [1 mg/kg, 15 experiments]; phase II: medium dose [2 mg/kg, 30 experiments]; and phase III: high dose [5-7 mg/kg, 10 experiments]). Plasma levels of cocaine were estimated. The low dose induced sinus bradycardia, sinus arrhythmia, atrial ectopic, wandering pacemaker, unifocal ventricular premature contractions, and ventricular couplets. The medium dose generated moderately severe arrhythmias that were of supraventricular origin. Atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation were observed in two experiments each. Ventricular arrhythmias were manifested as unifocal, multifocal, interpolated ventricular premature contractions as well as bigeminy, trigeminy, couplets, and salvos. The high dose of 5-7 mg/kg increased electrocardiographic intervals and caused ST-segment elevation as well as serious life-threatening arrhythmias. Three of the dogs developed sustained ventricular tachycardia followed by ventricular flutter-fibrillation and death.",

    "abstract": "Objective\u2014 To determine whether n-3 fatty acids (n-3) influence arterial cholesterol delivery and lipoprotein lipase (LpL) levels in insulin-resistant mice. Methods and Results\u2014 Insulin resistance contributes to risk of cardiovascular disease. It was previously reported that saturated fat (SAT) diets increased, but n-3 diets decreased, arterial low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol deposition from LDL total and selective uptake; this was associated with increased or decreased arterial LpL, respectively. Insulin receptor transgenic knockout mice (L1) were fed a chow, SAT, or n-3 diet for 12 weeks. Double-fluorescent boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)\u2013cholesteryl ester (CE) and Alexa dye-labeled human LDL were injected to separately trace LDL-CE and LDL\u2013apolipoprotein B whole particle uptake. In contrast to SAT, n-3 diets markedly reduced all plasma lipids, ameliorating progression of insulin resistance. As opposed to SAT, n-3 reduced arterial LDL uptake, CE deposition, and selective uptake. Disparate patterns of CE deposition between diets were comparable with arterial LpL distribution; SAT induced high LpL levels throughout aortic media; LpL was limited only to intima in n-3\u2013fed mice. Conclusion\u2014 n-3 diets diminish arterial LDL-cholesterol deposition in mice with insulin resistance, and this is associated with changes in arterial LpL levels and distribution.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT There is an emerging paradigm shift from coronary heart disease having a purely hereditary and nutritional causation to possibly having an infectious etiology. Recent epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between periodontal disease and coronary heart disease. However, to date, there is minimal information as to the possible disease mechanisms of this association. It is our hypothesis that invasion of the coronary artery cells by oral bacteria may start and/or exacerbate the inflammatory response in atherosclerosis. Since a few periodontal pathogens have been reported to invade oral epithelial tissues, we tested the ability of three putative periodontal pathogens\u2014 Eikenella corrodens , Porphyromonas gingivalis , and Prevotella intermedia \u2014to invade human coronary artery endothelial cells and coronary artery smooth muscle cells. In this study we demonstrate by an antibiotic protection assay and electron microscopy that specific species and strains invade coronary artery cells at a significant level. Actin polymerization and eukaryotic protein synthesis in metabolically active cells were required since the corresponding inhibitors nearly abrogated invasion. Many intracellular P. gingivalis organisms were seen to be present in multimembranous vacuoles resembling autophagosomes by morphological analysis. This is the first report of oral microorganisms invading human primary cell cultures of the vasculature.",

Rat ANP (rANP) mutants that bind rat NPR-A selectively over rat NPR-C were isolated from randomized libraries of rANP-display phage by differential panning. One variant was identified with reduced NPR-C binding; rANP (G16R, A17E, Q18A) [rANP(REA18)]. Synthetic rANP(REA18) was equipotent with rANP in stimulating cGMP production from cloned rat NPR-A (ED50 = 1.8 nM) and was reduced in NPR-C binding by approximately 200-fold. When infused into conscious rats at 0.325 microg/min for 30 min rANP elicited an identical decrease in blood pressure compared with 0.25 microg/min of rANP(REA18), however the natriuretic (P < 0.05) and diuretic (P = 0.07) responses to rANP(REA18) were greater. These data are consistent with a role for NPR-C as a local decoy receptor attenuating NPR-A effects in the kidney, where these receptors are coexpressed. Improved NPR-A specificity could provide more effective natriuretic peptides for treatment of acute renal failure or heart failure.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D insufficiency is a global health issue. Although classically associated with rickets, low vitamin D levels have also been linked to aberrant immune function and associated health problems such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To test the hypothesis that impaired vitamin D status predisposes to IBD, 8-wk-old C57BL/6 mice were raised from weaning on vitamin D-deficient or vitamin D-sufficient diets and then treated with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) to induce colitis. Vitamin D-deficient mice showed decreased serum levels of precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (2.5 \u00b1 0.1 vs. 24.4 \u00b1 1.8 ng/ml) and active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (28.8 \u00b1 3.1 vs. 45.6 \u00b1 4.2 pg/ml), greater DSS-induced weight loss (9 vs. 5%), increased colitis (4.71 \u00b1 0.85 vs. 1.57 \u00b1 0.18), and splenomegaly relative to mice on vitamin D-sufficient chow. DNA array analysis of colon tissue (n = 4 mice) identified 27 genes consistently (P &amp;lt; 0.05) up-regulated or down-regulated more than 2-fold in vitamin D-deficient vs. vitamin D-sufficient mice, in the absence of DSS-induced colitis. This included angiogenin-4, an antimicrobial protein involved in host containment of enteric bacteria. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that colonic angiogenin-4 protein was significantly decreased in vitamin D-deficient mice even in the absence of colitis. Moreover, the same animals showed elevated levels (50-fold) of bacteria in colonic tissue. These data show for the first time that simple vitamin D deficiency predisposes mice to colitis via dysregulated colonic antimicrobial activity and impaired homeostasis of enteric bacteria. This may be a pivotal mechanism linking vitamin D status with IBD in humans.",

    "title": "Renal nerves in the pathogenesis of hypertension in experimental animals and humans",
    "abstract": "Efferent renal innervation is composed of postganglionic sympathetic fibers to the renal arterioles, juxtaglomerular apparatus, and renal tubules. Increased efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity results in increased renal vascular resistance, renin release, and sodium retention. These responses from enhanced renal sympathetic activity contribute to normal cardiovascular homeostasis but could also facilitate the development of hypertension by shifting the arterial pressure-renal sodium excretion curve to the right. Accordingly, interruption of the renal nerves should prevent the development of hypertension in animal models in which increased sympathetic nervous system activity has been implicated. Renal denervation delays the development of hypertension and results in greater sodium excretion in the Okamoto and New Zealand spontaneously hypertensive rat and in the DOCA-salt-treated rat, suggesting that these responses are due, at least in part, to loss of efferent renal nerve activity. Similar sympathetically mediated renal vasoconstriction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of early essential hypertension in man. Recent studies indicate that the kidney is a sensory organ with mechano-receptive and chemoreceptive afferent renal nerves involved in renorenal and cardiovascular regulation. Renal denervation in established one-kidney one-clip and two-kidney one-clip Goldblatt hypertension in the rat and chronic coarctation in the dog results in an attenuation of the hypertension. The depressor effect of renal denervation in these models is not due to change in renin activity or sodium excretion but is associated with decreased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. These findings suggest that the afferent renal nerves contribute to the pathogenesis of renovascular hypertension by enhancing the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. The role of the afferent renal nerves in renovascular hypertension in humans warrants further study.",

    "title": "Nitric oxide regulation of superoxide and peroxynitrite-dependent lipid peroxidation. Formation of novel nitrogen-containing oxidized lipid derivatives",
    "abstract": "Superoxide (O2-.), nitric oxide (.NO), and their reaction product peroxynitrite (ONOO-) have all been shown to independently exert toxic target molecule reactions. Because these reactive species are often generated in excess during diverse inflammatory and other pathologic circumstances, we assessed the influence of .NO on membrane lipid peroxidation induced by O2-., H2O2, and .OH derived from xanthine oxidase (XO) and by ONOO-. Experimental conditions in lipid oxidation systems were adjusted to yield different rates of delivery of .NO, relative to rates of O2-. and H2O2 generation, by infusion of either .NO or via .NO released from S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine or S-nitrosoglutathione. Peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine liposomes was assessed by formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive products and by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Liposomes exposed to XO-derived reactive species in the presence of .NO exhibited both stimulation and inhibition of lipid peroxidation, depending on the ratio of the rates of reactive oxygen species production and .NO introduction into reaction systems. Nitric oxide alone did not induce lipid peroxidation. Linolenic acid emulsions peroxidized by XO-derived reactive species showed similar dose-dependent regulation of lipid peroxidation by .NO. Mass spectral analysis of oxidation products showed formation of nitrito-, nitro-, nitrosoperoxo-, and/or nitrated lipid oxidation adducts, demonstrating that .NO serves as a potent terminator of radical chain propagation reactions. Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis of incubation mixtures provided no evidence for formation of paramagnetic iron-lipid-nitric oxide complexes in reaction systems. Peroxynitrite-dependent lipid peroxidation, which predominantly occurs by metal-independent mechanisms, was also inhibited by .NO. Peroxynitrite-mediated benzoate hydroxylation was partially inhibited by .NO, inferring reaction between .NO and ONOOH. It is concluded that .NO can both stimulate O2-./H2O2/.OH-induced lipid oxidation and mediate oxidant-protective reactions in membranes at higher rates of .NO production, with the prooxidant versus antioxidant outcome critically dependent on relative concentrations of individual reactive species. Prooxidant reactions of .NO will occur after O2-. reaction with .NO to yield potent secondary oxidants such as ONOO- and the antioxidant effects of .NO a consequence of direct reaction with alkoxyl and peroxyl radical intermediates during lipid peroxidation, thus terminating lipid radical chain propagation reactions.",

New agents including the small-molecule targeted inhibitors sunitinib, sorafenib and temsirolimus and the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab have shown anti-tumor efficacy and have become the standard of care for most patients. Sunitinib and temsirolimus have shown significant improvements in overall survival (OS), in the first-line setting, when compared with interferon. Sorafenib has demonstrated prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in a phase III study in comparison with placebo in the second-line setting. More recently, two phase III studies have compared bevacizumab and interferon with interferon alone. Both studies showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS for the combination arm but no difference in OS. Everolimus showed prolonged PFS in the second/third-line setting. Pazopanib prolongs PFS in na\u00efve/cytokine refractory patients. Immunotherapy confers a small but significant OS advantage but only for the minority of patients with good prognostic features. The results of these trials and ongoing efforts to improve treatment of MRCC are the focus of this review.",

    "abstract": "Low dietary intakes of the n -3 long-chain PUFA (LCPUFA) EPA and DHA are thought to be associated with increased risk for a variety of adverse outcomes, including some psychiatric disorders. Evidence from observational and intervention studies for a role of n -3 LCPUFA in depression is mixed, with some support for a benefit of EPA and/or DHA in major depressive illness. The present study was a double-blind randomised controlled trial that evaluated the effects of EPA+DHA supplementation (1\u00b75 g/d) on mood and cognitive function in mild to moderately depressed individuals. Of 218 participants who entered the trial, 190 completed the planned 12 weeks intervention. Compliance, confirmed by plasma fatty acid concentrations, was good, but there was no evidence of a difference between supplemented and placebo groups in the primary outcome \u2013 namely, the depression subscale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales at 12 weeks. Mean depression score was 8\u00b74 for the EPA+DHA group and 9\u00b76 for the placebo group, with an adjusted difference of \u2212 1\u00b70 (95 % CI \u2212 2\u00b78, 0\u00b78; P = 0\u00b727). Other measures of mood, mental health and cognitive function, including Beck Depression Inventory score and attentional bias toward threat words, were similarly little affected by the intervention. In conclusion, substantially increasing EPA+DHA intake for 3 months was found not to have beneficial or harmful effects on mood in mild to moderate depression. Adding the present result to a meta-analysis of previous relevant randomised controlled trial results confirmed an overall negligible benefit of n -3 LCPUFA supplementation for depressed mood.",

    "abstract": "Abstract For the treatment of hemophilia patients with inhibitors, recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is available as a therapeutic option to control bleeding episodes with a good balance of safety and efficacy. The short in-vivo half-life of approximately 2.5 h requires multiple injections, which is inconvenient for treaters and patients. Here we describe the generation of a half-life extended recombinant FVIIa molecule based on genetic fusion of FVIIa to human albumin. In this fusion protein the design of the linker sequence is important to optimize the effect of the albumin moiety on FVII activity. The recombinant FVII-albumin fusion protein (rVII-FP) was expressed in mammalian cells and upon activation displayed a FVII activity comparable to wild type rFVIIa. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats and rabbits demonstrated that the half-life of the activated recombinant FVII albumin fusion protein (rVIIa-FP) was 6 to 9 fold extended compared to wild type rFVIIa. The in-vitro and in-vivo efficacy was evaluated and found comparable to commercially available rFVIIa (NovoSeven\u00ae). The results of this study demonstrate that it is feasible to improve the attributes of a rVIIa molecule by extending its half life, while retaining a molecule with very similar hemostatic properties to the wild type factor.",

    "abstract": "2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME), an endogenous estrogen metabolite which disrupts microtubule function, has been shown to inhibit proliferating cells in vitro and suppress certain murine tumors in vivo. In vitro screening has determined that breast cancer cell lines are most sensitive to inhibition by 2-ME. Additionally, 2-ME has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vitro. We tested whether 2-ME suppresses cytokine-induced angiogenesis in vivo and inhibits growth of a human breast carcinoma in severe combined immunodeficient mice. A model of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced corneal neovascularization in C57BL/6 mice was used to evaluate the antiangiogenic effects of 2-ME and other microtubule inhibitors such as Taxol, vincristine, and colchicine. 2-ME (150 mg/kg p.o., n = 20) inhibited bFGF and VEGF-induced neovascularization by 39% and 54%, respectively. Taxol (6 mg/kg i.p., n = 17) inhibited bFGF and VEGF-induced neovascularization by 45% and 37%, respectively. Vincristine (0.2 mg/kg i.p., n = 8) and colchicine (0.25 mg/kg i.p., n = 8) had no effect. Treatment with 2-ME (75 mg/kg p.o., n = 9) for 1 month suppressed the growth of a human breast carcinoma in mice by 60% without toxicity. Recognition of the antiangiogenic and antitumor properties of 2-ME and Taxol may be crucial in planning clinical applications to angiogenesis-dependent diseases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Evaluation of the immunogenicity of panitumumab, a fully human anti-epidermal growth factor receptor mAb approved for use in colorectal cancer patients, led to the development of two separate immunoassays for the detection of anti-panitumumab Abs. The first immunoassay used a bridging ELISA capable of detecting 10 ng/ml positive control anti-panitumumab Ab. The ELISA incorporated an acid dissociation step to reduce drug interference and tolerated the presence of \u223c100-fold molar excess of drug. During eight clinical trials, the ELISA detected developing Ab responses in 2 of 612 (0.3%) subjects. In one of the ELISA positive subjects, neutralizing Abs were detected using an epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation bioassay. The second immunoassay used a Biacore biosensor immunoassay format capable of detecting 1 \u03bcg/ml positive control Ab while tolerating the presence of equal molar amounts of drug. Although less sensitive and less tolerant to competing drug in the assay, the Biacore assay detected developing Ab responses in 25 of the 604 (4.1%) subjects. Additionally, the Biacore assay identified eight subjects who developed neutralizing Abs. Mouse mAbs with affinities ranging from 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 8.4 \u00d7 10\u221210 M were used to characterize both assay types. The ELISA was more sensitive for the detection of higher affinity mAbs and detected high-affinity mAbs in the presence of higher molar ratio of drug to mAb. The Biacore assay was more sensitive for detection of lower affinity mAbs and detected low affinity Abs in the presence of higher molar ratios of drug to mAb.",

The ability of LM to gain access to the host cell cytosol allows proteins secreted by the bacterium to efficiently enter the pathway for major histocompatibility complex class I antigen processing and presentation. We have established a genetic system for expression and secretion of foreign antigens by recombinant strains, based on stable site-specific integration of expression cassettes into the LM genome. The ability of LM recombinants to induce protective immunity against a heterologous pathogen was demonstrated with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). LM strains expressing the entire LCMV nucleoprotein or an H-2Ld-restricted nucleoprotein epitope (aa 118-126) were constructed. Immunization of mice with LM vaccine strains conferred protection against challenge with virulent strains of LCMV that otherwise establish chronic infection in naive adult mice. In vivo depletion of CD8+ T cells from vaccinated mice abrogated their ability to clear viral infection, showing that protective anti-viral immunity was due to CD8+ T cells.",

    "title": "Peptide Agonist Docking in the N-terminal Ectodomain of a Class II G Protein-coupled Receptor, the VPAC1 Receptor",
    "abstract": "The neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) strongly impacts on human pathophysiology and does so through interaction with class II G protein-coupled receptors named VIP pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) receptors (VPACs). The molecular nature of VIP binding to receptors remains elusive. In this work, we have docked VIP in the human VPAC1 receptor by the following approach. (i) VIP probes containing photolabile residues in positions 6, 22, and 24 of VIP were used to photolabel the receptor. After receptor cleavage and Edman sequencing of labeled receptor fragments, it was shown that Phe6, Tyr22, and Asn24 of VIP are in contact with Asp107, Gly116, and Cys122 in the N-terminal ectodomain (N-ted) of the receptor, respectively. (ii) The structure of VIP was determined by NMR showing a central alpha helix, a disordered N-terminal His1-Phe6 segment and a 3(10) Ser25-Asn28 helix termination. (iii) A three-dimensional model of the N-ted of hVPAC1 was constructed by using the NMR structure of the N-ted of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2beta as a template. As expected, the fold is identified as a short consensus repeat with two antiparallel beta sheets and is stabilized by three disulfide bonds. (iv) Taking into account the constraints provided by photoaffinity, VIP was docked into the hVPAC1 receptor N-ted. The 6-28 fragment of VIP nicely lies in the N-ted C-terminal part, but the N terminus region of VIP is free for interacting with the receptor transmembrane region. The data provide a structural rationale to the proposed two-step activation mechanism of VPAC receptor and more generally of class II G protein-coupled receptors.",

    "abstract": "While antibody engineering improves the properties of therapeutic antibodies, optimization of regions that do not contact antigens has been mainly focused on modifying the effector functions and pharmacokinetics of antibodies. We recently reported an asymmetric anti-FIXa/FX bispecific IgG4 antibody, ACE910, which mimics the cofactor function of FVIII by placing the two factors into spatial proximity for the treatment of hemophilia A. During the optimization process, we found that the activity was significantly affected by IgG subclass and by modifications to the inter-chain disulfide bonds, upper hinge region, elbow hinge region, and Fc glycan, even though these regions were unlikely to come into direct contact with the antigens. Of these non-antigen-contacting regions, the tertiary structure determined by the inter-chain disulfide bonds was found to strongly affect the FVIII-mimetic activity. Interestingly, IgG4-like disulfide bonds between Cys131 in the heavy chain and Cys114 in the light chain, and disulfide bonds between the two heavy chains at the hinge region were indispensable for the high FVIII-mimetic activity. Moreover, proline mutations in the upper hinge region and removal of the Fc glycan enhanced the FVIII-mimetic activity, suggesting that flexibility of the upper hinge region and the Fc portion structure are important for the FVIII-mimetic activity. This study suggests that these non-antigen-contacting regions can be engineered to improve the biological activity of IgG antibodies with functions similar to ACE910, such as placing two antigens into spatial proximity, retargeting effector cells to target cells, or co-ligating two identical or different antigens on the same cell.",

    "title": "Identification of a family of Fc receptor homologs with preferential B cell expression",
    "abstract": "Investigation of human genome sequences with a consensus sequence derived from receptors for the Fc region of Igs (FcR) led to the identification of a subfamily of five Ig superfamily members that we term the Fc receptor homologs (FcRHs). The closely linked FcRH genes are located in a chromosome 1q21 region in the midst of previously recognized FcR genes. This report focuses on the FcRH1 , FcRH2 , and FcRH3 members of this gene family. Their cDNAs encode type I transmembrane glycoproteins with 3\u20136 Ig-like extracellular domains and cytoplasmic domains containing consensus immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating and/or inhibitory signaling motifs. The five FcRH genes are structurally related, and their protein products share 28\u201360% extracellular identity with each other. They also share 15\u201331% identity with their closest FcR relatives. The FcRH genes are expressed primarily, although not exclusively, by mature B lineage cells. Their conserved structural features, patterns of cellular expression, and the inhibitory and activating signaling potential of their transmembrane protein products suggest that the members of this FcRH multigene family may serve important regulatory roles in normal and neoplastic B cell development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wild-type ErbB-2 (E2) positive D2F2/E2 tumors are rejected by active vaccination with ErbB-2 DNA. However, anti-ErbB-2 Ab response can cause cardiac toxicity or interfere with cellular immunity. It will be advantageous to induce only cellular immunity by active vaccination. A panel of E2 DNA vaccines were constructed, and their vaccination efficacy was ranked as E2 &amp;gt; tyrosine kinase-deficient ErbB-2 (E2A) &amp;gt; full-length ErbB-2 targeted to the cytoplasm (cytE2) &amp;gt; tyrosine kinase-deficient cytE2 (cytE2A). E2A is a tyrosine kinase-deficient mutant containing a single residue substitution. CytE2 or cytE2A encodes a full-length protein that is targeted to and rapidly degraded in the cytosol by the proteasomes. Covaccination with cytE2A and GM-CSF or IL-2 DNA resulted in equivalent anti-tumor activity as E2. However, anti-ErbB-2 Ab was induced by E2 or E2A, but not cytE2 or cytE2A. Therefore, cytE2A appears to induce anti-tumor immunity without an Ab response. ErbB-2-specific CTL were detected in mice immunized with cytE2A and GM-CSF and have rejected tumor challenge. Depletion of CD8, but not CD4 T cells reduced anti-tumor immunity, indicating CTL as the effector cells. Covaccination with E2A and cytE2A induced synergistic anti-tumor activity, supporting enhanced peptide presentation from cytE2A, which was further evidenced by superior CTL activation using APCs expressing cytE2 vs E2. Taken together, cytoplasmic ErbB-2 DNA induced anti-tumor CTL, but not humoral response, demonstrating the feasibility of eliciting individual effector mechanism by targeted DNA vaccine.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Arabidopsis trichome development and differentiation is a well-studied model for plant cell-fate determination and morphogenesis. Mutations in TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1) result in several pleiotropic defects including an almost complete lack of trichomes. The complex phenotype caused by ttg1 mutations is suppressed by ectopic expression of the maize anthocyanin regulator R. Here it is demonstrated that the Arabidopsis trichome development locus GLABRA3 (GL3) encodes an R homolog. GL3 and GLABRA1 (GL1) interact when overexpressed together in plants. Yeast two-hybrid assays indicate that GL3 participates in physical interactions with GL1, TTG1, and itself, but that GL1 and TTG1 do not interact. These data suggest a reiterated combinatorial model for the differential regulation of such diverse developmental pathways as trichome cell-fate determination, root hair spacing, and anthocyanin secondary metabolism.",

    "title": "Hypoxia promotes invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells by increasing lysyl oxidase expression",
    "abstract": "There is compelling evidence from transgenic mouse studies and analysis of mutations in human carcinomas indicating that the TGF-\u03b2 signal transduction pathway is tumor suppressive.We have shown that overexpression of TGF-\u03b21 in mammary epithelial cells suppresses the development of carcinomas and that expression of a dominant negative type II TGF-\u03b2 receptor (DNIIR) in mammary epithelial cells under control of the MMTV promoter/enhancer increases the incidence of mammary carcinomas.Studies of human tumors have demonstrated inactivating mutations in human tumors of genes encoding proteins involved in TGF-\u03b2 signal transduction, including DPC4/Smad4, Smad2, and the type II TGF-\u03b2 receptor (T\u03b2RII).There is also evidence that TGF-\u03b2 can enhance the progression of tumors.This hypothesis is being tested in genetically modified mice.To attain complete loss of T\u03b2RII, we have generated mice with loxP sites flanking exon 2 of Tgfbr2 and crossed them with mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the MMTV promoter/enhancer to obtain Tgfbr2 mgKO mice.These mice show lobuloalveolar hyperplasia.Mice are being followed for mammary tumor development.Tgfbr2 mgKO mice that also express polyoma virus middle T antigen under control of the MMTV promoter (MMTV-PyVmT) develop mammary tumors with a significantly shorter latency than MMTV-PyVmT mice and show a marked increase in pulmonary metastases.Our data do not support the hypothesis that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in mammary carcinoma cells is important for invasion and metastasis, at least in this model system.The importance of stromal-epithelial interactions in mammary gland development and tumorigenesis is well established.These interactions probably involve autocrine and paracrine action of multiple growth factors, including members of the TGF-\u03b2 family, which are expressed in both stroma and epithelium.Again, to accomplish complete knockout of the type II TGF-\u03b2 receptor gene in mammary stromal cells, FSP1-Cre and Tgfbr2 flox/flox mice were crossed to attain Tgfbr2 fspKO mice.The loss of TGF-\u03b2 responsiveness in fibroblasts resulted in intraepithelial neoplasia in prostate and invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the forestomach with high penetrance by 6 weeks of age.Both epithelial lesions were associated with an increased abundance of stromal cells.Activation of paracrine hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling was identified as one possible mechanism for stimulation of epithelial proliferation.TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts thus modulates the growth and oncogenic potential of adjacent epithelia in selected tissues.More recently, we have examined the effects of Tgfbr2 fspKO fibroblasts on normal and transformed mammary epithelium.We analyzed the role of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by stromal cells in mammary tumor progression.To avoid the possibility of endogenous wild-type fibroblasts masking potential effects of Tgfbr2 fspKO cells on tumor progression, we implanted PyVmT mammary carcinoma cells with Tgfbr2 fspKO or wildtype fibroblasts in the subrenal capsule of nude mice.Mammary tumor cells implanted with Tgfbr2 fspKO cells exhibited an increase in tumor growth and intravasation associated with an increase in tumor cell survival, proliferation and an increase in tumor angiogenesis compared with tumor cells implanted with control fibroblasts.We demonstrated increased expression of several growth factors by Tgfbr2 fspKO fibroblasts compared with control fibroblasts in primary culture.These included HGF, MSP and TGF-\u03b1.There was an increase in tumor cell activating phosphorylation of the cognate receptors, c-Met, RON, erbB1, and erbB2 in carcinomas accompanied by Tgfbr2 fspKO fibroblasts.The Tgfbr2 fspKO mouse model illustrates that a signaling pathway known to suppress cell-cycle progression when activated in epithelial cells can also have an indirect inhibitory effect on epithelial proliferation when activated in adjacent stromal fibroblasts in vivo.Loss of this inhibitory effect can result in increased epithelial proliferation and may even progress to invasive carcinoma in some tissues.",

    "abstract": "Administration of therapeutic proteins by methods other than injection is limited, in part, by inefficient penetration of epithelial barriers. Therefore, unique approaches to breaching these barriers are needed. The neonatal constant region fragment (Fc) receptor (FcRn), which is responsible for IgG transport across the intestinal epithelium in newborn rodents, is expressed in epithelial cells in adult humans and non-human primates. Here we show that FcRn-mediated transport is functional in the lung of non-human primates and that this transport system can be used to deliver erythropoietin (Epo) when it is conjugated to the Fc domain of IgG1. FcRn-dependent absorption was more efficient when the EpoFc fusion protein was deposited predominantly in the upper and central airways of the lung, where epithelial expression of FcRn was most prominently detected. To optimize fusion protein absorption in the lung, we created a recombinant \u201cmonomeric-Epo\u201d Fc fusion protein comprised of a single molecule of Epo conjugated to a dimeric Fc. This fusion protein exhibited enhanced pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The bioavailability of the EpoFc monomer when delivered through the lung was approximately equal to that reported for unconjugated Epo delivered s.c. in humans. These studies show that FcRn can be harnessed to noninvasively deliver bioactive proteins into the systemic circulation in therapeutic quantities.",

    "abstract": "Protein transduction domains (PTDs), such as the third helix of the Drosophila Antennapedia homeobox gene (Antp) and the HIV TAT PTD, possess a characteristic positive charge on the basis of their enrichment for arginine and lysine residues. To determine whether cationic peptides are able to function as protein transduction domains, 12-mer peptide sequences from an M13 phage library were selected for synthesis on the basis of their varying cationic charge content. In addition, polylysine and polyarginine peptides were synthesized in order to assess the effect of charge contribution in protein transduction. Coupling of the biotinylated peptides to avidin-beta-galactosidase facilitated transduction in a wide variety of cell lines and primary cells, including islet beta-cells, synovial cells, polarized airway epithelial cells, dendritic cells, myoblasts, and tumor cells. Two of the peptides, PTD-4 and PTD-5, mediated transduction nearly 600-fold more efficiently than a random control peptide, but with an efficiency similar to the TAT PTD and the 12 mers of polylysine and polyarginine. Furthermore, confocal analysis of biotinylated peptide-streptavidin-Cy3 conjugates demonstrated that the internalized PTDs are found in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm of treated cells. When tested in vivo, the PTDs were able to facilitate efficient and rapid protein delivery into rabbit synovium and mouse solid tumors following intraarticular and intratumoral administration, respectively. These novel PTDs can be used to transfer therapeutic proteins and DNA for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases, including arthritis and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Self-Protection Mechanism Kaposi's sarcoma\u2013associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes an AIDS-associated cancer. During its lytic phase, the virus produces a noncoding polyadenylated nuclear RNA that accumulates to high levels in infected cells. This occurs because a helix-loop-helix element, called ENE within the RNA, that contains a uridine-rich internal loop, sequesters the poly(A) tail, preventing the initiation of RNA decay. Mitton-Fry et al. (p. 1244 ) have determined the 2.5 angstrom structure of the ENE core bound to the RNA. Instead of just binding to the uridine-rich loop, as was expected, the poly(A) tail interacts with the loop and lower stem to form a triple helix to prevent decay. Similar mechanisms may protect other noncoding RNAs from rapid turnover.",

    "title": "Identification by molecular cloning of two forms of the \u03b1\u2010subunit of the human liver stimulatory (G<sub>s</sub>) regulatory component of adenylyl cyclase",
    "abstract": "Two DNA molecules complementary to human liver mRNA coding for the \u03b1\u2010subunit of the stimulatory regulatory component G s of adenylyl cyclase were cloned. One of the two forms is a full\u2010length cDNA of 1614 nucleotides plus a poly(A) tail of 59 nucleotides. The deduced sequence of 394 amino acids encoded by its open reading frame is essentially identical to that of the \u03b1\u2010subunits of G s identified by molecular cloning from bovine adrenals, bovine brain and rat brain. Two independent clones of the other type of cDNA were isolated. Both were incomplete, beginning within the open reading frame coding for the \u03b1 s polypeptide. One codes for amino acids 5 through 394 and the other for amino acids 48 through 394 of the above described cDNA of 1614 nucleotides, and both have the identical 3'\u2010untranslated sequence. They differ from the first cDNA, however, in that they lack a stretch of 42 nucleotides (numbers 214 through 255) and have nucleotides 213 (G) and 256 (G) replaced with C and A, respectively. This results in a predicted amino acid composition of another \u03b1\u2010subunit of G s that is shorter by 14 amino acids and contains two substitutions (Asp for Glu and Ser for Gly) at the interface between the deletion and the unchanged sequence. We call the smaller subunit \u03b1 s1 and the larger \u03b1 s2 . This is the first demonstration of a structural heterogeneity in \u03b1 s , subunits that is due to a difference in amino acid sequence.",

    "title": "Colloidal Gold: A Novel Nanoparticle Vector for Tumor Directed Drug Delivery",
    "abstract": "Colloidal gold, a sol comprised of nanoparticles of Au(0), has been used as a therapeutic for the treatment of cancer as well as an indicator for immunodiagnostics. However, the use of these gold nanoparticles for in vivo drug delivery has never been described. This communication outlines the development of a colloidal gold (cAu) nanoparticle vector that targets the delivery of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to a solid tumor growing in mice. The optimal vector, designated PT-cAu-TNF, consists of molecules of thiol-derivatized PEG (PT) and recombinant human TNF that are directly bound onto the surface of the gold nanoparticles. Following intravenous administration, PT-cAu-TNF rapidly accumulates in MC-38 colon carcinoma tumors and shows little to no accumulation in the livers, spleens (i.e., the RES) or other healthy organs of the animals. The tumor accumulation was evidenced by a marked change in the color of the tumor as it acquired the bright red/purple color of the colloidal gold sol and was coincident with the active and tumor-specific sequestration of TNF. Finally, PT-cAu-TNF was less toxic and more effective in reducing tumor burden than native TNF since maximal antitumor responses were achieved at lower doses of drug.",

    "title": "Sensitive and accurate detection of copy number variants using read depth of coverage",
    "abstract": "Methods for the direct detection of copy number variation (CNV) genome-wide have become effective instruments for identifying genetic risk factors for disease. The application of next-generation sequencing platforms to genetic studies promises to improve sensitivity to detect CNVs as well as inversions, indels, and SNPs. New computational approaches are needed to systematically detect these variants from genome sequence data. Existing sequence-based approaches for CNV detection are primarily based on paired-end read mapping (PEM) as reported previously by Tuzun et al. and Korbel et al. Due to limitations of the PEM approach, some classes of CNVs are difficult to ascertain, including large insertions and variants located within complex genomic regions. To overcome these limitations, we developed a method for CNV detection using read depth of coverage. Event-wise testing (EWT) is a method based on significance testing. In contrast to standard segmentation algorithms that typically operate by performing likelihood evaluation for every point in the genome, EWT works on intervals of data points, rapidly searching for specific classes of events. Overall false-positive rate is controlled by testing the significance of each possible event and adjusting for multiple testing. Deletions and duplications detected in an individual genome by EWT are examined across multiple genomes to identify polymorphism between individuals. We estimated error rates using simulations based on real data, and we applied EWT to the analysis of chromosome 1 from paired-end shotgun sequence data (30\u00d7) on five individuals. Our results suggest that analysis of read depth is an effective approach for the detection of CNVs, and it captures structural variants that are refractory to established PEM-based methods.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT One of the early steps in the biosynthesis of coenzyme F 420 in Methanocaldococcus jannaschii requires generation of 2-phospho- l -lactate, which is formed by the phosphorylation of l -lactate. Preliminary studies had shown that l -lactate in M. jannaschii is not derived from pyruvate, and thus an alternate pathway(s) for its formation was examined. Here we report that l -lactate is formed by the NAD + -dependent oxidation of l -lactaldehyde by the MJ1411 gene product. The lactaldehyde, in turn, was found to be generated either by the NAD(P)H reduction of methylglyoxal or by the aldol cleavage of fuculose-1-phosphate by fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase, the MJ1418 gene product.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to test the hypothesis that aberrantly modified forms of superoxide dismutase (SOD1) influence the disease course for sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS). We probed for anti-SOD1 antibodies (IgM and IgG) against both the normal and aberrantly oxidized-SOD1 (SODox) antigens in sera from patients with SALS, subjects diagnosed with other neurological disorders and healthy individuals, and correlated the levels of these antibodies to disease duration and/or severity. Anti-SOD1 antibodies were detected in all cohorts; however, a subset of \u223c5-10% of SALS cases exhibited elevated levels of anti-SOD1 antibodies. Those SALS cases with relatively high levels of IgM antibodies against SODox exhibit a longer survival of 6.4 years, compared to subjects lacking these antibodies. By contrast, SALS subjects expressing higher levels of IgG antibodies reactive for the normal WT-SOD1 antigen exhibit a shorter survival of 4.1 years. Anti-SOD1 antibody levels did not correlate with disease severity in either the Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease cohorts. In conclusion, the association of longer survival with elevated levels of anti-SODox antibodies suggests that these antibodies may be protective. By extension, these data implicate aberrantly modified forms of WT-SOD1 (e.g. oxidized SOD1) in SALS pathogenesis. In contrast, an immune response against the normal WT-SOD1 appears to be disadvantageous in SALS, possibly because the anti-oxidizing activity of normal WT-SOD1 is beneficial to SALS individuals.",

    "title": "Genetic Engineering and Significant Ex-Vivo Expansion of Cord Blood Natural Killer Cells: Implications for Post-Transplant Adoptive Cellular Immunotherapy",
    "abstract": "Abstract Natural killer (NK) cells are a critical component of both the innate and adaptive human immune response (Caligiuri et al, Blood 2008). Tumor target cell recognition by NK cells is a highly regulated and complex set of processes which are controlled by the balance between inhibitory and activating signals through the binding of a variety of ligands on tumor target cells by several distinct subtypes of NK cell receptors (Bryceson YT et al, Immun Rev, 2006). The major limitations of the use of NK cells in adoptive tumor cellular immunotherapy include lack of tumor recognition and activation and/or limited numbers of viable and functionally active NK cells (Shereck/Cairo et al, Pediatr Blood Cancer, 2007). To circumvent these limitations, methods to expand and/or activate peripheral blood NK cells have been developed. Over the past decade cord blood (CB) has been increasingly utilized as an alternative to peripheral blood for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Cairo et al, Blood, 1997). We recently reported the successful expansion and functional activation of CB NK cells by ex-vivo cellular engineering with a cocktail of antibody and cytokines (Ayello/Cairo et al, BBMT, 2006). In addition, our group has had a major interest in the diagnosis, treatment and biology of childhood CD20+ B-NHL; and have identified subgroups of patients with a significantly poorer prognosis despite aggressive multiagent chemotherapy (Cairo et al, Blood, 2007). In this study we sought to to develop an adoptive cellular immunotherapy strategy to overcome chemotherapy drug resistant childhood B-NHL. Freshly isolated CB mononuclear cells (CBMC) were cultured with modified K562 cells expressing membrane bound IL15 and 4-1BB ligand (K562-mbIL15-41BBL; Imai et al, Blood, 2005). After irradiation with 100Gy, K562- mbIL15-41BBL cells were incubated in a 1:1 ratio with CBMC + 10 IU/mL rhIL-2 for 7\u201314 days. CD3 and CD56 expression was determined by flow cytometry at Days 0, 7 and 14. On Day 0, CBMC included a population of NK cells expressing CD56 of 3.9% \u00b1 1.3% and CD3+ T cells of 48.3% \u00b1 3.9%. After 7 days of culture with K562-mbIL15- 41BBL cells the percentage of CD56+/CD3\u2212 NK cells increased to 71.7% \u00b1 3.9%, as compared to 9.7% \u00b1 2.4% in cultures with media alone and 42.6% \u00b1 5.9% in cultures with wild-type K562 cells (p&amp;lt;0.01). There was also a significant decrease in the percentage of T cells in cultures with the modified K562 cells compared to wild-type K562 and media alone (15.2% \u00b1 2.2% vs 35.4% \u00b1 4.4% vs 51.2% \u00b1 7.1%, p&amp;lt;0.001). Overall, the percent of NK cells after 7 days of culture with K562-mbIL15-41BBL was 3374% \u00b1 385% of the input cell number, i.e. an approximate 35-fold increase. This is significantly increased compared to culture with wild-type K562 (1771% \u00b1 300%, p&amp;lt;0.05). On Day 14, there remained a significant difference in NK cell populations between CBMC incubated with modified K562 cells compared to wild-type K562 cells (62.0% \u00b1 2.1% vs 27.9% \u00b1 2.4%, p&amp;lt;0.001), and compared to media alone (5.5% \u00b1 0.4%, p&amp;lt;0.001) but no further increase from Day 7. Expansion of NK cells using genetically modified K562 cells as a stimulus produced significantly higher numbers of NK cells than those previously observed using a cocktail of antibody and cytokines as a stimulus (Ayello/Cairo et al, BBMT, 2006): (71.7% \u00b1 3.9% NK cells on Day 7 with modified K562 vs 33.9% \u00b1 8.7% with AB/CY, p=0.0004). In summary, we have demonstrated CBMC can be stimulated by K562 cells expressing membrane bound IL15 and 4-1BB ligand (K562-mbIL15-41BBL) resulting in specific expansion of CB NK cells similar or higher than the expansion that can be obtained with peripheral blood. The method described here provides a means to promote CB NK-mediated cellular cytotoxicity for use in the post-transplant setting while minimizing the risk of graft-versus-host disease.",

    "abstract": "We have constructed and characterized a polyoma virus-based plasmid that is maintained as an autonomously replicating extrachromosomal element (episome) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Plasmid pMGD20neo contains the polyoma origin of replication harboring a mutated enhancer (PyF101), a modified polyoma early region that encodes the large tumor (T) antigen only, and a gene that confers resistance to G418 (neo). After transfection, the plasmid replicates in ES cells and is maintained as an extrachromosomal element in 15% of G418-resistant clones. Integration of the plasmid DNA is undetectable for at least 28 cell generations. In one clone, the transfected DNA persists unaltered as an episome at 10-30 copies per cell for at least 74 cell generations in the presence of G418. Cells that maintain the autonomously replicating plasmid can efficiently replicate and maintain a second plasmid that carries the polyoma origin of replication. Independent vector-containing ES cell lines showed no significant alteration of the karyotype, and two cell lines yielded several chimeric animals when introduced into blastocysts, suggesting that the presence of an episomal element and expression of polyoma large T do not eliminate the ES cells' ability to populate an embryo. This system offers an efficient means for manipulating and analyzing various aspects of gene expression in ES cells.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) bacterial immunity targets invading nucleic acid sequences using an RNA guide (gRNA). The well-defined Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes' type II CRISPR system has been utilized as a gene editing tool in a vast assortment of organisms. However, an inherent lack of specificity limits the potential of the current system and presents challenges to interpreting experimental results. A plasmid cleavage based screening platform has been developed with the intent to increase the fidelity of the Cas9 system. Utilizing both positive and negative selection, the screen can be used to identify variants of Cas9 or its gRNA with improved specificity. Positive selection of variants with activity towards the appropriate target site proceeds through the removal of a plasmid containing an inducible suicide gene. Conversely, negative selection of variants with reduced activity on off-target substrates involves the retention of a plasmid with an antibiotic resistance gene. Preliminary results suggest that a gRNA with an insertion in the scaffold region of the RNA can decrease the level of off-target cleavage. These results suggest that the screening platform has the potential to identify novel protein or RNA variants with greater targeting specificity compared to the naturally occurring components. A Cas9 system with enhanced fidelity will expand the potential applications of the technology and accelerate its ability to interrogate biological systems.",

In continuous culture, succinate productivity was 3 g/liter/h, and the yield was 60%. Under conditions of excess CO 2 , more than 90% of the whey-lactose was consumed, with an end product ratio of 4 succinate to 1 acetate. Under conditions of limited CO 2 , lactose was only partially consumed and lactate was the major end product, with lower levels of ethanol, succinate, and acetate. When the succinic acid in this fermentation product was added to rumen fluid, it was completely consumed by a mixed rumen population and was 90% decarboxylated to propionate on a molar basis. The whey fermentation product formed under excess CO 2 , which contained mainly organic acids and cells, could potentially be used as an animal feed supplement.",

    "abstract": "Over recent years, requests for mtDNA analysis in the field of forensic medicine have notably increased, and the results of such analyses have proved to be very useful in forensic cases where nuclear DNA analysis cannot be performed. Traditionally, mtDNA has been analyzed by DNA sequencing of the two hypervariable regions, HVI and HVII, in the D-loop. DNA sequence analysis using the conventional Sanger sequencing is very robust but time consuming and labor intensive. By contrast, mtDNA analysis based on the pyrosequencing technology provides fast and accurate results from the human mtDNA present in many types of evidence materials in forensic casework. The assay has been developed to determine polymorphic sites in the mitochondrial D-loop as well as the coding region to further increase the discrimination power of mtDNA analysis. The pyrosequencing technology for analysis of mtDNA polymorphisms has been tested with regard to sensitivity, reproducibility, and success rate when applied to control samples and actual casework materials. The results show that the method is very accurate and sensitive; the results are easily interpreted and provide a high success rate on casework samples. The panel of pyrosequencing reactions for the mtDNA polymorphisms were chosen to result in an optimal discrimination power in relation to the number of bases determined.",

    "title": "Breast tumor kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 mediate Met receptor signaling to cell migration in breast cancer cells",
    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Breast tumor kinase (Brk/protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6)) is a nonreceptor, soluble tyrosine kinase overexpressed in the majority of breast tumors. Previous work has placed Brk downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB) activation and upstream of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Herein we investigate the regulation of Brk kinase activity and cell migration in response to treatment of keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) and breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells) with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and macrophage stimulating protein (MSP), peptide ligands for Met and Ron receptors, respectively. Methods In vitro kinase assays were performed to directly measure Brk kinase activity in response to MET and RON ligands. Transfection of Brk-targeted RNAi was used to knock down endogenous Brk or ERK5 in multiple cell lines. Kinase activities (downstream of MET signaling) were assayed by Western blotting using total and phospho-specific antibodies. Boyden chamber assays were used to measure cell migration in response to manipulation of Brk and downstream MET effectors. Rescue experiments were performed by knock down of endogenous Brk using RNAi (targeting the untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR)) and transient transfection (re-expression) of either wild-type or kinase-inactive Brk. Results Brk gene silencing revealed that HGF, but not MSP, induced robust Brk-dependent cell migration. Brk and ERK5 copurified in HGF-induced protein complexes, and Brk/ERK5 complexes formed independently of Brk kinase activity. ERK5 was required for breast cancer cell but not keratinocyte cell migration, which became ERK1/2-dependent upon ERK5 knockdown. Notably, rescue experiments indicated that the kinase activity of Brk was not required for HGF-induced cell migration. Further, expression of either wild-type or kinase-inactive Brk in Brk-null MDA-MB-435 cells activated ERK5 and conferred increased HGF-induced cell migration. Conclusions These results have identified Brk and ERK5 as important downstream effectors of Met signaling to cell migration. Targeting ERK5 kinase activity or inhibiting the formation of Brk/ERK5 complexes may provide an additional means of blocking cell migration associated with breast cancer progression to metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Depressed patients display a variety of deficits in neuropsychological function, and contradictory findings in the literature may be due to disorder heterogeneity. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of severity, subtype and symptoms on cognitive control. Methods: Neuropsychological function across a range of cognitive control tasks was examined in melancholic ( n = 65) and non-melancholic depressed patients ( n = 59) relative to controls ( n = 124). The relationship between subtype (melancholia vs non-melancholia) and anxiety was also examined. Results: Melancholia was characterised by attention and working memory deficits typically associated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while non-melancholia was characterised by verbal memory recall deficits indicative of left frontal lobe and medial temporal lobe function. The severity of anxious arousal and psychomotor disturbance contributed to cognitive impairment more than the severity of depression symptoms and anxious apprehension. Conclusions: Findings highlight a differential impact of depression subtype and severity, and suggest that anxious arousal and psychomotor disturbance may contribute to poorer performance on neuropsychological tasks associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex function.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective : To study the effect of weight loss in response to a lifestyle modification program on the circulating levels of adipose tissue derived cytokines (adipokines) in obese individuals with insulin resistance. Research Methods and Procedures : Twenty\u2010four insulin\u2010resistant obese subjects with varying degrees of glucose tolerance completed a 6\u2010month program consisting of combined hypocaloric diet and moderate physical activity. Adipokines [leptin, adiponectin, resistin, tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1), interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106)] and highly sensitive C\u2010reactive protein were measured before and after the intervention. Insulin sensitivity index was evaluated by the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Results : Participants had a 6.9 \u00b1 0.1 kg average weight loss, with a significant improvement in sensitivity index and reduction in plasma leptin (27.8 \u00b1 3 vs. 23.6 \u00b1 3 ng/mL, p = 0.01) and IL\u20106 (2.75 \u00b1 1.51 vs. 2.3 \u00b1 0.91 pg/mL, p = 0.012). TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels tended to decrease (2.3 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 1.9 \u00b1 0.1 pg/mL, p = 0.059). Adiponectin increased significantly only among diabetic subjects. The reductions in leptin were correlated with the decreases in BMI ( r = 0.464, p &lt; 0.05) and with changes in highly sensitive C\u2010reactive protein ( r = 0.466, p &lt; 0.05). Discussion : Weight reduction in obese individuals with insulin resistance was associated with a significant decrease in leptin and IL\u20106 and a tendency toward a decrease in circulating TNF\u2010\u03b1, whereas adiponectin was increased only in diabetic subjects. Further studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between changes of adipokines and the health benefits of weight loss.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: TAK\u2010165 is a new potent inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) tyrosine kinase. Several reports suggest HER2 expression in bladder cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and androgen\u2010independent prostate cancer. We therefore investigated the antitumor effect of TAK\u2010165 on these urological cancer cells. Materials and methods: Western blot analysis was performed to confirm HER2 expression in cell lines. To study in vitro efficacy, cells were treated with TAK\u2010165 at various concentrations for 72 h and then counted using a hemocytometer. Then the IC 50 value was calculated. In the xenograft model, after the tumor reached 200\u2013300 mm 3 in volume, mice were orally administered TAK\u2010165 10 mg/kg per day or 20 mg/kg per day or saline for 14 consecutive days ( n = 6\u20138). Results: HER2 expression was observed in HT1376, UMUC3, T24 (bladder), ACHN (kidney), DU145, LNCaP, LN\u2010REC4 (prostate), although the expression level in these cells was weak compared with BT474 (a breast cancer cell line which expresses HER2 strongly). IC 50 was varied from 0.09 to greater than 25 \u00b5mol/L in the bladder cancer cell line. ACHN cells were less sensitive in vitro . The prostate cancer cell lines studied were all sensitive (IC 50 0.053\u20134.62 \u00b5mol/L). In the xenograft model, treatment with TAK\u2010165 significantly inhibited growth of UMUC\u20103, ACHN, and LN\u2010REC4. The antitumor effect (T/C [%] = growth of TAK\u2010165 treated tumor/average growth of control tumor \u00d7 100) after 14 days treatment were 22.9%, 26.0%, and 26.5% in UMUC3, ACHN and LN\u2010REC4, respectively.

    "title": "Carbamylated erythropoietin ameliorates the metabolic stress induced <i>in vivo</i> by severe chronic hypoxia",
    "abstract": "Ischemia and chronic hypoxia (CH) trigger a variety of adverse effects arising from metabolic stress that injures cells. In response to reduced O 2 , hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) activates erythropoietin (Epo) as well as many other target genes that counteract the effects of O 2 deficiency. Epo produced by the kidney stimulates erythrocyte production, leading to decreased HIF-1\u03b1 production by improved tissue O 2 delivery. However, Epo is produced by many other tissues, and it is currently unclear to what extent, if any, locally produced Epo modulates HIF-1\u03b1 expression. Derivatives of Epo that possess tissue-protective activities but do not stimulate erythropoiesis [e.g., carbamylated Epo (CEpo)] are useful tools with which to determine whether exogenous Epo modulates HIF-1\u03b1 in the absence of changes in hemoglobin concentration. We compared the effects of CH (6.5% O 2 for 10 days) with or without CEpo administered by daily s.c. injection (10 \u03bcg/kg of body weight). CEpo administration did not alter the survival rate, weight loss, or increased hemoglobin concentration associated with CH. Therefore, CEpo does not directly suppress HIF-mediated erythropoiesis. CEpo does, however, prevent CH-induced neuronal increases of HIF-1\u03b1 and Epo receptor-associated immunoreactivity (a measure of stress) while reducing the apoptotic index. In contrast, the myocardium did not exhibit increased HIF-1\u03b1 expression during CH, although CEpo did reduce the apoptotic index. These observations therefore demonstrate that CEpo administration reduces the metabolic stress caused by severe CH, resulting in improved cellular survival independent of erythrocyte production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We have recently reported on the consecutive physisorption of anionic and cationic bipolar amphiphiles onto charged surfaces, adsorbed out of aqueous solutions [1]. Here, we extend our previous concept to multipolar compounds such as polyelectrolytes. In contrast to the bipolar amphiphile system, it is not necessary to separate single charges by a rigid unit, when the polyelectrolyte is adsorbed from sufficiently concentrated solutions. In this case the physisorbed layer does not bind with all ionic groups to the surface and exposes free ionic groups at the new film/solution interface. Therefore a polyelectrolyte layer can replace a layer of bipolar amphiphiles in the consecutive buildup of a multilayered assembly. The buildup of multilayers can then be described as follows: A solid substrate with a positively charged planar surface is immersed in the solution containing the negatively charged bipolar amphiphile, a monolayer of the amphiphile is adsorbed and due to its bipolar structure the surface charge is reversed. After rinsing in pure water the substrate is immersed in the solution containing the positively charged polyelectrolyte. Again a monolayer is adsorbed but now the original surface charge is restored. By repeating both steps in a cyclic fashion alternating multilayer assemblies of both compounds are obtained. In the same way multilayer assemblies can be prepared by using negatively charged polyelectrolytes and positively charged bipolar amphiphiles. It is demonstrated that multilayer films composed of at least 39 consecutively alternating layers, which corresponds to a total film thickness of 151 nm, can be assembled.",

    "abstract": "Unlike many classical signals and hormones, exposure of the cells to electrophilic molecules potentially induces a series of characteristic and wide-ranging biological responses by covalently attaching with macromolecules such as proteins as well as small cellular reductants. In addition to chemicals originated from xenobiotics or lipid peroxidation, electrophiles in foods have recently attracted much attention. These compounds have recently been found to induce expression of cytoprotective proteins that are involved in the elimination or inactivation of oxidative stress and carcinogenic electrophiles implicated in several pathogeneses. The redox-sensitive regulating systems such as Keap1/Nrf2/ARE play a key role in this induction and thus are considered to be the most important target of electrophiles in foods. This review highlights the food-derived electrophiles as promising protectors against various diseases, with an emphasis on possible molecular mechanisms. Current knowledge of isothiocyanates (ITCs), representative electrophile compounds from cruciferous vegetables, is discussed also, with consideration of the chemistry, metabolism, absorption, and factors influencing the biological activities of ITCs. In addition, this review attempts to provide a balanced perspective on the relative beneficial and harmful effects of the food electrophiles.",

    "abstract": "Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate\u2010limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines. We have studied the association of recombinant human TH with model membranes by using either liposomes or silica gel beads coated with single phospholipid bilayers (TRANSIL \u00ae ). The use of TRANSIL beads has allowed the determination of apparent dissociation constants ( K d ) for the binding of the enzyme to negatively charged bilayers ( K d =230\u2013380 \u03bcM, at pH 6.0\u20137.0). Binding to the bilayers is accompanied by a decrease in enzyme activity. Proteolysed forms of the enzyme show decreased binding affinity and two putative amphipathic N\u2010terminal \u03b1\u2010helices are proposed to be involved in membrane binding. As seen by circular dichroism, binding to the bilayer does not seem to induce significant changes on the secondary structure content of the enzyme, but \u03b1\u2010helical structures appear to be stabilized against thermal denaturation in the membrane\u2010bound state. Thus, amphitropism, a mechanism that regulates the function of peripheral proteins by weak binding to membrane lipids, may add to the factors that regulate both the activity and the stability of TH.",

VEGF mRNA transcripts were present in all six tested cell lines (ASPC-1, CAPAN-1, MIA-PaCa-2, PANC-1, COLO-357, and T3M4). Immunoblotting with a highly specific anti-VEGF antibody revealed the presence of VEGF protein in all of the cell lines. Northern blot analysis of total RNA revealed a 5.2-fold increase in VEGF mRNA transcript in the cancer samples in comparison with the normal pancreas. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization analysis confirmed the expression of VEGF in the cancer cells within the tumor mass. Immunohistochemical analysis of 75 pancreatic cancer tissues revealed the presence of strong VEGF immunoreactivity in the cancer cells in 64% of the cancer tissues. The presence of VEGF in these cells was associated with increased blood vessel number, larger tumor size, and enhanced local spread but not with decreased patient survival. These findings indicate that VEGF is commonly overexpressed in human pancreatic cancers and that this factor may contribute to the angiogenic process and tumor growth in this disorder.",

After a dose of 75 mg/kg, methylnitrosourea evoked progressive retinal degeneration in all treated rats whereas a dose of 50 mg/kg was less effective. The 75-mg/kg-treated rats showed selective destruction of the photoreceptor cells by an apoptotic mechanism, as confirmed morphologically and by the terminal dUTP nick end labeling method. Apoptosis had already started at 24 hours after the treatment and was completed by day 7. During the photoreceptor degeneration, proliferation of glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin-positive M\u00fcller cells as detected by proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling appeared at 48 hours and was prominent 72 hours after the treatment, and macrophage infiltration within the retina as recognized by ED1 positivity was maximal 7 and 21 days after the treatment. Retinal degeneration was also induced in female Brown-Norway colored rats in a similar dose-dependent manner. Pigment epithelium was discontinuous above Bruch's membrane, and migration of the swollen pigment epithelium toward the inner nuclear layer was seen 7 days after the treatment. Therefore, as also confirmed electron microscopically, the most striking change was the destruction of photoreceptor cells by the apoptotic process, followed by M\u00fcller cell proliferation, pigment epithelium migration, and macrophage infiltration for cell debris phagocytosis, resulting in a thin remnant of retina with attenuated inner nuclear cells in direct contact with Bruch's membrane or with the pigment epithelium and/or with the M\u00fcller cells 35 days after the treatment.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by peripheral activation of CD4(+) T cells that migrate into the central nervous system (CNS) and mount an autoimmune neuroinflammatory attack on myelin and oligodendrocytes. Secondary to these events, however equally destructive, is the generation of inflammatory-mediated reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generated by persistently activated microglia and astrocytes. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that regulates genetic expression of many protective antioxidant and detoxication enzymes. Here we describe the Nrf2 modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses in an acute autoimmune model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Wild-type (WT) mice and Nrf2 knockout mice were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG 35-55) and monitored daily for clinical scores of disease. Disruption of Nrf2 resulted in a more severe clinical course, a more rapid onset, and a greater percentage of mice with the disease. Furthermore, increased immune cell infiltration and glial cell activation in spine was observed. In conjunction, we observed increased inflammatory enzyme (iNOS, phox-47, gp91-phox, and phox-67), cytokine (IFN-gamma, IL1-b, TNF-alpha, and IL-12), and chemokine (BLC and MIG) gene expression levels in the Nrf2-deficient mice compared to the WT mice, supporting the notion that Nrf2 can modulate an autoimmune neuroinflammatory response. Our results show that the absence of Nrf2 exacerbates the development of EAE and thus suggests that activation of Nrf2 may then attenuate pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as MS as well as other neurodegenerative diseases that present with neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "The collagens belong to the constituents of the subendothelium that determine the thrombogenicity of the vessel wall. The existence of several genetically distinct collagens is well documented. To date, 19 collagens have been characterized. The collagens are divided into the fibril forming collagens and the non-fibril forming collagens. At least nine of the different collagens--type I, III, IV, V, VI, VIII, XII, XIII, XIV--were found in the vessel wall. All collagen molecules are built of three chains in a triple-helical conformation. Some collagens also contain large parts of non-collagenous domains. An interesting example for complex collagens is collagen type VI for it shares non-collagenous domains with the von Willebrand factor A domain, the platelet glycoprotein Ib, fibronectin type III repeats, and Kunitz type protease inhibitor. Monomeric and fibrillar collagens effectively support platelet adhesion, whereas for collagen-induced platelet aggregation and secretion, the native, triple-helical structure of collagen is required. The platelet reactive sites in collagens type I and III have been studied intensively. Using CNBr-peptides three aggregatory sites in the alpha 1(I) chain and one in the alpha 1(III) chain have been found. Cyanogen bromide fragments of collagen type I were also used to measure platelet adhesion under flow conditions. alpha 1(I)CB3 strongly supports platelet adhesion. The two peptides alpha 1(I)CB3 and alpha 1(III)CB4 are highly homologous. alpha 1(III)CB4 is highly aggregatory. Several substances are known to interfere at different levels with the platelet-collagen interactions and have been identified in blood-feeding animals. Among them are the \"leech anti-platelet protein\" (LAPP), calin, moubatin, and pallidipin.",

    "abstract": "Hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of protein tau are typical for neurodegenerative tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). We demonstrate here that human tau expressed in yeast acquired pathological phosphoepitopes, assumed a pathological conformation, and formed aggregates. These processes were modulated by yeast kinases Mds1 and Pho85, orthologues of GSK-3beta and cdk5, respectively. Surprisingly, inactivation of Pho85 increased phosphorylation of tau-4R, concomitant with increased conformational change defined by antibody MC1 and a 40-fold increase in aggregation. Soluble protein tau, purified from yeast lacking PHO85, spontaneously and rapidly formed tau filaments in vitro. Further fractionation of tau by anion-exchange chromatography yielded a hyperphosphorylated monomeric subfraction, termed hP-tau/MC1, with slow electrophoretic mobility and enriched with all major epitopes, including MC1. Isolated hP-tau/MC1 vastly accelerated in vitro aggregation of wild-type tau-4R, demonstrating its functional capacity to initiate aggregation, as well as its structural stability. Combined, this novel yeast model recapitulates hyperphosphorylation, conformation, and aggregation of protein tau, provides insight in molecular changes crucial in tauopathies, offers a source for isolation of modified protein tau, and has potential for identification of modulating compounds and genes.",

    "abstract": "The steroid hormone estrogen regulates many functionally unrelated processes in numerous tissues. Although it is traditionally thought to control transcriptional activation through the classical nuclear estrogen receptors, it also initiates many rapid nongenomic signaling events. We found that of all G protein\u2013coupled receptors characterized to date, GPR30 is uniquely localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it specifically binds estrogen and fluorescent estrogen derivatives. Activating GPR30 by estrogen resulted in intracellular calcium mobilization and synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in the nucleus. Thus, GPR30 represents an intracellular transmembrane estrogen receptor that may contribute to normal estrogen physiology as well as pathophysiology.",

    "title": "Differential regulation of two types of intracellular calcium release channels during end-stage heart failure.",
    "abstract": "The molecular basis of human heart failure is unknown. Alterations in calcium homeostasis have been observed in failing human heart muscles. Intracellular calcium-release channels regulate the calcium flux required for muscle contraction. Two forms of intracellular calcium-release channels are expressed in the heart: the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R). In the present study we showed that these two cardiac intracellular calcium release channels were regulated in opposite directions in failing human hearts. In the left ventricle, RyR mRNA levels were decreased by 31% (P < 0.025) whereas IP3R mRNA levels were increased by 123% (P < 0.005). In situ hybridization localized both RyR and IP3R mRNAs to human cardiac myocytes. The relative amounts of IP3 binding sites increased approximately 40% compared with ryanodine binding sites in the failing heart. RyR down-regulation could contribute to impaired contractility; IP3R up regulation may be a compensatory response providing an alternative pathway for mobilizing intracellular calcium release, possibly contributing to the increased diastolic tone associated with heart failure and the hypertrophic response of failing myocardium.",

    "abstract": "Aortas of 13-day-old chick embryo were labeled for 0.5 hr with [14C]lysine and subjected to a serial extraction after chase for 1-24 hr with [12C]lysine. Substantial radioactivity was found in insoluble elastin after 3 hr chase. The effect of beta-amino-propionitrile on labeling with [14C]lysine was also examined. Each fraction was hydrolyzed and applied to a short column on an amino acid analyzer. Radioactivity was found in desmosine and isodesmosine of insoluble elastin as early as 1 hr after the beginning of chase. The radioactivity increased rapidly at 2 hr and very slowly thereafter. A large count, which was separated into five peaks on a long column, was observed in other lysine derivatives at 2 hr and increased steadily up to 24 hr, while the lysine count decreased from 1 : 0.5 to 1 : 6 against lysine derivatives and from 1 : 0.04 to 1 : 0.9 against quarter-desmosine after 24 hr. The oxidation of lysine residues incorporated during the 0.5 hr pulse was almost completed during the first 1 hr of chase, and these oxidized residues were incorporated into crosslinks during the following 1 hr. It is suggested that poorly crosslinked elastin accumulated in the soluble fractions. The presence of crosslinking derived from lysine residues was also indicated in the microfibril fraction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective. To examine the usefulness of determining extended serum cytokine profiles in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), for the purpose of improving differential diagnosis and monitoring disease activity. Methods. In a 2\u2010year prospective study, serum levels of interleukin\u20101\u03b2 (IL\u20101\u03b2), soluble IL\u20102 receptor (sIL\u20102R), IL\u20106, IL\u20108, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), and the p55 soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR) were repeatedly determined by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay in 40 patients with JRA, 13 patients with postinfectious arthropathies, and 30 healthy controls. The data were compared with conventional parameters of inflammation, such as C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), iron and hemoglobin levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood cell (WBC) counts, and platelet counts. WBC subsets were analyzed by flow cytofluorometry. Results. At the first visit and at the peak of inflammatory activity according to CRP levels and/or ESR, serum levels of sIL\u20102R, IL\u20106, and sTNFR in JRA patients correlated significantly with conventional inflammation indicators, whereas IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20108, and TNF\u03b1 did not. No changes in leukocyte subset distribution were noted. Among the different clinical subtypes of JRA, sIL\u20102R, IL\u20106, and sTNFR values at the time of the initial visit showed a pattern similar to CRP, whereby patients with systemic disease exhibited by far the highest values. TNF\u03b1 and IL\u20101\u03b2 were variably elevated in certain JRA subtypes. Patients with postinfectious arthropathies showed elevated levels of CRP, sIL\u20102R, TNF\u03b1, and sTNFR, which did not differ significantly from levels in the various JRA subtypes with the exception of systemic disease. Detailed analysis of types I and II pauciarticular JRA revealed that levels of CRP, IL\u20101\u03b2, and TNF\u03b1 were elevated in patients with type I disease. While these parameters were invariably normal in patients with type II disease, sTNFR and sIL\u20102R were still found to be significantly elevated. Followup studies suggested that persistently high sTNFR values are a better indicator of JRA activity than are measurements of other cytokines or CRP. Conclusion. JRA is associated with significant and consistent changes in serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and soluble receptors. For the clinical monitoring of JRA, determination of levels of sTNFR, and to some extent sIL\u20102R, may be particularly useful, since these determinations yield information about subtype and/or activity of disease that is not available from conventional parameters of inflammation.",

Here we report the observation of a 120,000-Mr protein whose phosphorylation on tyrosine correlates with the induction of morphological transformation. p120 was not observed in cells overexpressing the regulated, nononcogenic pp60c-src, whereas phosphorylation of p120 was greatly enhanced in cells expressing activated, oncogenic pp60527F. Furthermore, phosphorylation of p120 was not induced by expression of the activated but nonmyristylated src variant pp602A/527F, which is transformation defective. p120 partitioned preferentially with cellular membranes, consistent with the observation that transforming src proteins are membrane associated. Although a number of additional putative substrates were identified and partially characterized with respect to intracellular localization, tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was not tightly linked to transformation.",

    "title": "Lestaurtinib Enhances the Antitumor Efficacy of Chemotherapy in Murine Xenograft Models of Neuroblastoma",
    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose: Neuroblastoma, a common pediatric tumor of the sympathetic nervous system, is characterized by clinical heterogeneity. The Trk family neurotrophin receptors play an important role in this behavior. Expression of TrkA is associated with favorable clinical features and outcome, whereas TrkB expression is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. We wanted to determine if the Trk-selective inhibitor lestaurtinib had therapeutic efficacy in a preclinical neuroblastoma model. Experimental Design: We performed intervention trials of lestaurtinib alone or in combination with other agents in TrkB-overexpressing neuroblastoma xenograft models. Results: Lestaurtinib alone significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to vehicle-treated animals [P = 0.0004 for tumor size and P = 0.011 for event-free survival (EFS)]. Lestaurtinib also enhanced the antitumor efficacy of the combinations of topotecan plus cyclophosphamide (P &amp;lt; 0.0001 for size and P &amp;lt; 0.0001 for EFS) or irinotecan plus temozolomide (P = 0.011 for size and P = 0.012 for EFS). There was no additive benefit of combining either 13-cis-retinoic acid or fenretinide with lestaurtinib compared to lestaurtinib alone. There was dramatic growth inhibition combining lestaurtinib with bevacizumab (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), but this combination had substantial systemic toxicity. Conclusions: We show that lestaurtinib can inhibit the growth of neuroblastoma both in vitro and in vivo and can substantially enhance the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy, presumably by inhibition of the Trk/brain-derived neurotrophic factor autocrine survival pathway. It may also enhance the efficacy of selected biological agents, but further testing is required to rule out unanticipated toxicities. Our data support the incorporation of Trk inhibitors, such as lestaurtinib, in clinical trials of neuroblastoma or other tumors relying on Trk signaling pathways for survival.

We measured lung volume, the volume of individual alveoli, and alveolar surface area and calculated alveolar number in neonatal rats in which septation had been blocked by treatment with a glucocorticosteroid hormone and in adult tight-skin mice that have a genetic failure of septation. We tested the hypothesis that treatment with all- trans retinoic acid induces post hoc septation.

    "abstract": "To assess the diagnostic value of procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and standard measurements in identifying critically ill patients with sepsis, we performed prospective measurements in 78 consecutive patients admitted with acute systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and suspected infection. We estimated the relevance of the different parameters by using multivariable regression modeling, likelihood-ratio tests, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). The final diagnosis was SIRS in 18 patients, sepsis in 14, severe sepsis in 21, and septic shock in 25. PCT yielded the highest discriminative value, with an AUC of 0.92 (CI, 0.85 to 1.0), followed by IL-6 (0.75; CI, 0.63 to 0.87), and IL-8 (0.71; CI, 0.59 to 0.83; p < 0.001). At a cutoff of 1.1 ng / ml, PCT yielded a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 78% to differentiate patients with SIRS from those with sepsis-related conditions. Median PCT concentrations on admission (ng / ml, range) were 0.6 (0 to 5.3) for SIRS; 3.5 (0.4 to 6.7) for sepsis; 6.2 (2.2 to 85) for severe sepsis; and 21.3 (1.2 to 654) for septic shock (p < 0.001). The addition of PCT to a model based solely on standard indicators improved the predictive power of detecting sepsis (likelihood ratio test; p = 0.001) and increased the AUC value for the routine value-based model from 0.77 (CI, 0.64 to 0.89) to 0.94 (CI, 0.89 to 0.99; p = 0.002). In contrast, no additive effect was seen for IL-6 (p = 0.56) or IL-8 (p = 0.14). Elevated PCT concentrations appear to be a promising indicator of sepsis in newly admitted, critically ill patients capable of complementing clinical signs and routine laboratory parameters suggestive of severe infection.Keywords: Critical care; biological markers, blood; calcitonin, blood; protein precursors, blood; interleukin-6, blood; interleukin-8, blood; sepsis, blood, diagnosis; sepsis syndrome, blood, diagnosis",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Interaction of microbes with their environment depends on features of the dynamic microbial surface throughout cell growth and division. Surface modifications, whether used to acquire nutrients, defend against other microbes, or resist the pressures of a host immune system, facilitate adaptation to unique surroundings. The release of bioactive membrane vesicles (MVs) from the cell surface is conserved across microbial life, in bacteria, archaea, fungi, and parasites. MV production occurs not only in vitro but also in vivo during infection, underscoring the influence of these surface organelles in microbial physiology and pathogenesis through delivery of enzymes, toxins, communication signals, and antigens recognized by the innate and adaptive immune systems. Derived from a variety of organisms that span kingdoms of life and called by several names (membrane vesicles, outer membrane vesicles [OMVs], exosomes, shedding microvesicles, etc.), the conserved functions and mechanistic strategies of MV release are similar, including the use of ESCRT proteins and ESCRT protein homologues to facilitate these processes in archaea and eukaryotic microbes. Although forms of MV release by different organisms share similar visual, mechanistic, and functional features, there has been little comparison across microbial life. This underappreciated conservation of vesicle release, and the resulting functional impact throughout the tree of life, explored in this review, stresses the importance of vesicle-mediated processes throughout biology.",

It is known that heterogeneity of gut microbiome in populations may result in different outcomes of therapy. In xenograft model, bacteria in gut have been proved as a crucial factor regulating immunotherapy efficacy. And the similar phenomenon was obtained in patients.

Characterization of 35S-proteoglycans by chondroitin ABC lyase treatment revealed approximately 36% of the proteoglycan to be composed of chondroitin sulfates. Analysis by HPLC of component disaccharides liberated by chondroitin ABC lyase using an amino-cyano-substituted silica column indicated that the chondroitin sulfates consisted of the monosulfated A disaccharide (GlcUA\u2192GaINAc4SO4) (75%) and the over-sulfated E disaccharide (GlcUA\u2192GaINAc4,6-diSO4) (25%).

Proteoglycans remaining after exposure of the original proteoglycan extract to either heparinase or chondroitin ABC lyase were of similar size, suggesting that the majority of heparin and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans were on separate protein cores. Proteoglycans extracted from HLMC were protease insensitive. Hence, in addition to heparin proteoglycans, HLMC synthesize a hitherto unrecognized quantity of chondroitin sulfate E proteoglycans.",

In this review, we discuss the prognostic and predictive role of EGFR in HNSCC, focusing on the different molecular alterations in specific treatment modalities such as radiotherapy alone (RT), combination of surgery, RT and chemotherapy (CT), EGFR inhibitors. We considered EGFR at different molecular levels: protein expression, protein activation, gene copy number, polymorphisms, mutation, EGFRvIII expression and EGFR ligand expression.Considering RT alone, evidence supports the predictive and prognostic role of high EGFR expression only when evaluated by quantitative assays: this may help select the patients who can mostly benefit from accelerated treatment. Conversely, no predictive biomarkers are available when treatment is a combination of surgery, CT and RT. For this combined treatment, several studies indicate that EGFR expression represents a good prognostic parameter only when measured by a \"quantitative\" or at least semi-quantitative method. With respect to EGFR inhibitors, neither EGFR expression nor increased gene copy number represent prognostic/predictive factors.If validated, nuclear EGFR, TGF\u03b1 levels, EGFR phopshorylation and polymorphisms could represent additional prognostic factors in relation to combination of surgery, CT and RT, while EGFR polymorphisms and high amphiregulin levels could have prognostic value in patients treated with EGFR inhibitors.",

GLV-1h237 was found to have higher replication efficiency and enhanced cytotoxity than GLV-1h68 in cell culture. In the GI-101A tumor xenograft animal model, GLV-1h237 turned out to be the most potent oncolytic virus strain investigated. A single i.v. injection of GLV-1h237 resulted in enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to GLV-1h68 concomitant with a high tumor selectivity and a comparable safety profile. Thus, the strategy to combine oncolytic virotherapy with agents that interfere with host cell DNA synthesis is a promising approach for effective cancer therapy.",

    "title": "Human Tumor-Released Microvesicles Promote the Differentiation of Myeloid Cells with Transforming Growth Factor-\u03b2\u2013Mediated Suppressive Activity on T Lymphocytes",
    "abstract": "Abstract Human tumors constitutively release endosome-derived microvesicles, transporting a broad array of biologically active molecules with potential modulatory effects on different immune cells. Here, we report the first evidence that tumor-released microvesicles alter myeloid cell function by impairing monocyte differentiation into dendritic cells and promoting the generation of a myeloid immunosuppressive cell subset. CD14+ monocytes isolated from healthy donors and differentiated with interleukin (IL)-4 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the presence of tumor-derived microvesicles turned into HLA-DR\u2212/low cells, retaining CD14 expression and failing to up-regulate costimulatory molecules, such as CD80 and CD86. These phenotypic changes were paralleled by a significant release of different cytokines, including IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), and a dose-dependent suppressive activity on activated T-cell\u2013proliferation and cytolytic functions, which could be reversed by anti-TGF-\u03b2\u2013neutralizing antibodies. Microvesicles isolated from plasma of advanced melanoma patients, but not from healthy donors, mediated comparable effects on CD14+ monocytes, skewing their differentiation toward CD14+HLA-DR\u2212/low cells with TGF-\u03b2\u2013mediated suppressive activity on T-cell\u2013functions. Interestingly, a subset of TGF-\u03b2\u2013secreting CD14+HLA-DR\u2212 cells mediating suppressive activity on T lymphocytes was found to be significantly expanded in peripheral blood of melanoma patients compared with healthy donors. These data suggest the development in cancer patients of an immunosuppressive circuit by which tumors promote the generation of suppressive myeloid cells through the release of circulating microvesicles and without the need for cell-to-cell contact. Therapeutic interventions on the crucial steps of this pathway may contribute to restore tumor/immune system interactions favoring T-cell\u2013mediated control of tumor growth in cancer patients.

    "abstract": "A method has been developed whereby a very large number of colonies of Escherichia coli carrying different hybrid plasmids can be rapidly screened to determine which hybrid plasmids contain a specified DNA sequence or genes. The colonies to be screened are formed on nitrocellulose filters, and, after a reference set of these colonies has been prepared by replica plating, are lysed and their DNA is denatured and fixed to the filter in situ. The resulting DNA-prints of the colonies are then hybridized to a radioactive RNA that defines the sequence or gene of interest, and the result of this hybridization is assayed by autoradiography. Colonies whose DNA-prints exhibit hybridization can then be picked from the reference plate. We have used this method to isolate clones of ColE1 hybrid plasmids that contain Drosophila melanogaster genes for 18 and 28S rRNAs. In principle, the method can be used to isolate any gene whose base sequence is represented in an available RNA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A humanized IgG4 anti\u2013HLA-DR monoclonal antibody (IMMU-114), engineered to avoid side effects associated with complement activation, was examined for binding and cytotoxicity on leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma cell lines and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient specimens, followed by evaluation of the effects of IMMU-114 on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. HLA-DR was expressed on the majority of these cells at markedly higher levels than CD20, CD22, and CD74. IMMU-114 was toxic to mantle cell lymphoma, CLL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (including rituximab-resistant), and multiple myeloma cell lines, and also patient CLL cells. IMMU-114 induced disease-free survival in tumor-bearing SCID mice with early-stage disease and in models that are relatively resistant to anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Despite positive staining, acute myelogenous leukemic cells were not killed by IMMU-114. The ability of IMMU-114 to induce activation of ERK and JNK signaling correlated with cytotoxicity and differentiates the mechanism of action of IMMU-114 from monoclonal antibodies against CD20 and CD74. Thus, antigen expression is not sufficient for cytotoxicity; antibody-induced hyperactivation of ERK and JNK mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathways are also required.",

We accelerated the image acquisition speed by a factor of 10 and adapted the system for light sources emitting at 820nm. The improved instrument records 1000 transversal lines per second. Two different scanning modes enable either the acquisition of high resolution B-scan images containing 1600x500 pixels in 500ms or the recording of 3D data sets by C-scan mode imaging. This allows acquiring a 3D-data set containing 1000x100x100 pixels in 10 seconds. We present polarization sensitive B-scan images and to the best of our knowledge, the first 3D-data sets of retardation and fast axis orientation of fovea and optic nerve head region in vivo.

    "abstract": "\u2713 Malignant gliomas have been difficult to treat with chemotherapy. The most effective agent, BCNU (carmustine), has considerable systemic toxicity and a short half-life in serum. To obviate these problems, a method has been developed for the local sustained release of chemotherapeutic agents by their incorporation into biodegradable polymers. Implantation of the drug-impregnated polymer at the tumor site allows prolonged local exposure with minimal systemic exposure. In this Phase I\u2013II study, 21 patients with recurrent malignant glioma were treated with BCNU released interstitially by means of a polyanhydride biodegradable polymer implant. Up to eight polymer wafers were placed in the resection cavity intraoperatively, upon completion of tumor debulking. The polymer releases the therapeutic drug for approximately 3 weeks. Three increasing concentrations of BCNU were studied; the treatment was well tolerated at all three levels. There were no adverse reactions to the BCNU wafer treatment itself The average survival period after reoperation was 65 weeks for the first dose group, 64 weeks for the second dose group, and 32 weeks for the highest dose group. The overall mean survival time was 48 weeks from reoperation and 94 weeks from the original operation. The overall median survival times were 46 weeks postimplant and 87 weeks from initial surgery. Eighteen (86%) of 21 patients lived more than 1 year from the time of their initial diagnosis and eight (38%) of 21 patients lived more than 1 year after intracranial implantation of the polymer. Frequent hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis tests did not reveal any systemic effect from this interstitial chemotherapy. Since the therapy is well tolerated and safe, a placebo-controlled clinical trial has been started. The trial will measure the effect of the second treatment dose on survival of patients with recurrent malignant glioma.",

The potential therapeutic specificity and efficacy of such treatments are obvious to anyone who studies the exquisite specificity and cytocidal potency of immune responses. However, the value assigned to a therapeutic modality by the oncology community at large does not depend on scientific principle; all that matters is how patients respond. The bar for the ultimate acceptance of a therapy requires more than anecdotal clinical responses; rather, the major modalities of cancer therapeutics, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and, more recently, drugs targeting oncogenes, have earned their place only after producing dramatic frequent clinical responses or demonstrating statistically significant survival benefits in large randomized phase 3 clinical trials, leading to FDA approval.

    "abstract": "Several human cytokines including IL-2, GM-CSF, and tumor necrosis factors alpha and beta were engineered as fusion proteins to the carboxyl terminus of a chimeric anti-ganglioside antibody, ch14.18, and expressed in transfected hybridoma cells. All of the fusion proteins were expressed at high levels and were easily purified by affinity or ion-exchange chromatography from culture supernatants. The effect of fusion on antigen binding activity was tested and found to vary with the particular cytokine. No significant decreases in antigen binding were observed, and fusion of IL-2 had the greatest positive effect in a direct antigen binding assay. All fusion proteins maintained normal levels of biological activity except for GM-CSF, which was approximately 20% active, compared to recombinant GM-CSF produced in bacteria. The clearance of the fusion proteins was examined in normal Balb/c mice after intraperitoneal injection or in athymic (nu/nu) mice after intravenous injection and was generally quite rapid, relative to ch14.18. This was mainly due to a very rapid initial clearance rate (alpha phase) since the half-lives of the beta phase of the fusion proteins (about 30 h) were comparable to that of the free antibody (about 58 h). These results demonstrate that biologically active antibody/cytokine fusion proteins can be constructed by genetic engineering. Their relatively rapid clearance may require constant infusion rather than bolus injection in order to achieve clinical efficacy.",

Amongst them candidate biomarkers for early tumor diagnosis, prognosis and treatment have been detected. The suitability of several membrane-associated proteins as targets for drugs or antibodies has already been tested in preclinical and clinical studies. The results were encouraging in some cases, but not in all. They demonstrate that each type of tumor has its specific \"Achilles heel\", and that suitable targets of cancer diagnosis and therapy must be found for each kind of neoplasm. This implies that membrane-associated proteins for each type of tumor cell need to be investigated. This review describes the current technologies of membrane protein characterization in a first part and subsequently summarizes the membrane associated proteins currently being tested as targets for diagnosis and treatment in breast, prostate, thyroid, and colon cancer. Their function will be explained and their role in tumor biology will be discussed.",

In this study we examined the potential of TCI to boost preexisting immune responses to diphtheria in mice. The cross-reacting material (CRM 197 ) of diphtheria toxin was used as the boosting antigen and was administered alone or together with either one of two commonly used mucosal adjuvants, cholera toxin (CT) and a partially detoxified mutant of heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (LTR72). We report that TCI with CRM 197 significantly boosted preexisting immune responses elicited after parenteral priming with aluminum hydroxide-adsorbed diphtheria toxoid (DTxd) vaccine. In the presence of LTR72 as an adjuvant, toxin-neutralizing antibody titers were significantly higher than those elicited by CRM 197 alone and were comparable to the functional antibody levels induced after parenteral booster immunization with the adsorbed DTxd vaccine. Time course study showed that high levels of toxin-neutralizing antibodies persisted for at least 14 weeks after the transcutaneous boost. In addition, TCI resulted in a vigorous antigen-specific proliferative response in all groups of mice boosted with the CRM 197 protein. These findings highlight the promising prospect of using booster administrations of CRM 197 via the transcutaneous route to establish good herd immunity against diphtheria.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A rapid and highly sensitive silver staining method, originally developed for the detection of proteins, was slightly modified to detect nucleic acids in polyacrylamide gels. The second exons of the histocompatibility antigen HLA\u2010DQA1 and DQB1 genes were selectively amplified from genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Digestion of the PCR products by endonucleases, followed by their size separation on polyacrylamide gels and visualization by silver staining, allowed us to define the HLA\u2010DQ alleles of the genomic DNA. The in ensity of staining of digested PCR\u2010amplified DNA is linear from at least 8 to 18 ng for fragments of lengths ranging from approximately 40 to 200 bp. Thus, silver staining in combination with PCR and allele\u2010specific restriction fragment length polymorphism provides a simple, safe, and rapid method for accurate definition of HLA\u2010DQ alleles at the nucleotide level in the clinical typing laboratory.",

This non-enzymatic protocol circumvents several practical difficulties associated with DNA preparation for microarrays: the lack of reproducible fragmentation patterns associated with enzymatic methods; the large amount of labeled nucleic acids required by some array designs, which is often combined with a limited amount of starting material; and the high cost associated with currently used biotinylation methods. The method is applicable to any form of nucleic acid, but is particularly useful when applying double-stranded DNA on oligonucleotide arrays. Validation of this protocol is demonstrated by hybridizing PCR products with oligonucleotide-coated microspheres and PCR amplified cDNA with Affymetrix Cancer GeneChip microarrays.",

In continuation of previously reported structure-activity relationships on this chemotype, we have determined that at least one acyl group of optimal length (C(16)) and an appropriately oriented ester carbonyl group is essential for TLR2-agonistic activity. The spacing between one of the palmitoyl ester carbonyl and the thioether is crucial to allow for an important H-bond, which observed in the crystal structure of the lipopeptide:TLR2 complex; consequently, activity is lost in homologated compounds. Penicillamine-derived analogues are also inactive, likely due to unfavorable steric interactions with the carbonyl of Ser 12 in TLR2. The thioether in this chemotype can be replaced with a selenoether. Importantly, the thioglycerol motif can be dispensed with altogether and can be replaced with a thioethanol bridge. These results have led to a structurally simpler, synthetically more accessible, and water-soluble analogue possessing strong TLR2-agonistic activities in human blood.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients on antiretroviral regimens frequently develop a syndrome of abnormal fat distribution, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. This lipodystrophic syndrome has been most closely linked to the use of HIV protease inhibitors (PIs). Several mechanisms have been postulated to explain these adverse effects of PIs, based largely on studies of rodent adipocytes. Intriguingly, atazanavir, a newer PI equally effective against HIV, is associated with fewer signs of lipodystrophy. We hypothesized that the less deleterious clinical effects of atazanavir would be reflected in physiological differences observed in PI\u2010treated adipocytes. Research Methods and Procedures: We compared the effects of atazanavir and an older PI associated with lipodystrophy, ritonavir, on differentiation, gene expression, adipocytokine secretion, and insulin signaling in a human adipocyte cell line. Results: Ritonavir inhibited human adipocyte differentiation and induced apoptosis to a greater extent than atazanavir. Treatment of mature adipocytes with ritonavir, but not atazanavir, also selectively decreased insulin signaling. Moreover, ritonavir also selectively decreased expression of adiponectin, an insulin\u2010sensitizing adipocytokine, while inducing interleukin\u20106, a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in insulin resistance. Discussion: These data suggest that the distinct metabolic side effect profiles of these PIs could be a consequence of their differential effects on adipocyte physiology.",

Strong clinical evidence is accumulating on the prothrombotic tendency of cancer patients, which is enhanced by anticancer therapy, such as surgery and chemotherapy. The mechanisms of thrombus promotion in malignancy include some general responses of the host to the tumor (acute phase, inflammation, angiogenesis) and specific interactions of tumor cells with the clotting/fibrinolysis systems and with blood (leukocytes, platelets) or vascular cells. It is at present difficult to rank the relative weight of these multiple interactions on the basis of the well-recognized clinical evidence of enhanced thrombotic episodes in tumor patients. In any case, the mechanisms explored so far offer a sound experimental basis for prevention/treatment of thrombosis in tumor patients and leave open the possibility that some antithrombotic strategies may also affect the processes of tumor growth and dissemination.",

The mechanisms by which they regulate the stability and activity of p53 are not fully established. We have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mdmx bound to a 15-residue p53 peptide. The structure reveals that although the principle features of the Mdm2-p53 interaction are preserved in the Mdmx-p53 complex, the Mdmx hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 peptide binds is significantly altered: a part of the cleft is blocked by sidechains of Met and Tyr of the p53-binding pocket of Mdmx. Thus specific inhibitors of Mdm2-p53 would not be optimal for binding to Mdmx. Our binding assays show indeed that nutlins, the newly discovered, potent antagonists of the Mdm2-p53 interaction, are not capable to efficiently disrupt the Mdmx-p53 interaction. To achieve full activation of p53 in tumor cells, compounds that are specific for Mdmx are necessary to complement the Mdm2 specific binders.",

The results from four patients who were on long-term (&gt; or = 6 months) combination therapy with zidovudine and rifampin are presented. In all cases of combined use of zidovudine and rifampin, a lower area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and, consequently, a higher apparent clearance of zidovudine were found, compared with a reference population of zidovudine users. Patients had a low to normal maximum concentration of zidovudine in plasma. Elimination half-lives were normal in all but one patient. Zidovudine glucuronide concentrations were determined in three patients and three control subjects. The patients all had relatively higher peak plasma concentrations and higher AUCs of zidovudine glucuronide than the control subjects. In one patient, zidovudine and zidovudine glucuronide were also measured 2.5 months after discontinuation of rifampin. The AUC of zidovudine increased by a factor of 2. These data are in agreement with an enzyme-inducing effect of rifampin on the glucuronidation of zidovudine. They indicate that long-term combination therapy of rifampin and zidovudine leads to increased clearance of zidovudine, which may have therapeutic consequences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The placental hormone human CG (hCG) consists of two noncovalently linked \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits similar to the other glycoprotein hormones LH, FSH, and TSH. These heterodimers share a common \u03b1 subunit but differ in their structurally distinct \u03b2 subunits. The CG\u03b2 subunit is distinguished among the \u03b2 subunits by the presence of a C-terminal extension with four serine-linked oligosaccharides (carboxyl terminal peptide or CTP). In previous studies we observed that deleting this sequence decreased assembly of the truncated CG\u03b2 subunit (CG\u03b2114) with the \u03b1-subunit and increased the heterogeneity of the secreted forms of the uncombined subunit synthesized in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The latter result was attributed to alterations in the processing of the two N-linked oligosaccharides. To examine at what step this heterogeneity occurs, the CG\u03b2 and CG\u03b2114 genes were transfected into wild-type and mutant CHO cell lines that are defective in the late steps of the N-linked carbohydrate-processing pathway. We show here that removal of the CTP alters the processing of the core mannosyl unit of the subunit to complex forms at both glycosylation sites and that the oligosaccharides contain polylactosamine. Although it has been presumed that there is little intramolecular interaction between the CTP and the proximal domains of the subunit, our data suggest that the CTP sequence participates in the folding of the newly synthesized subunit, which is manifest by the posttranslational changes observed here.",

These proteins then communicate with additional proteins associated with the intracellular face of the membrane.

    "abstract": "The B lymphocyte cell surface receptor CD22 is an adhesion molecule that can mediate binding to several leukocyte subsets. The first CD22 ligand to be identified was the receptor-linked phosphotyrosine phosphatase CD45, but several lines of evidence suggest that CD22 may interact with multiple counter receptors on adjacent lymphocytes. In the present work, we show that in addition to CD45, a soluble CD22-immunoglobulin fusion protein (CD22Rg) recognizes several other distinct lymphocyte sialoglycoproteins. CD22-mediated adhesion is dependent upon the presence of sialic acids on ligands. CD22Rg is observed to bind specifically to a 115-kDa sialoglycoprotein in COS cells transfected with an alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase cDNA, but not in COS cells transfected with unrelated cDNA clones, indicating that at least some CD22-mediated interactions require presentation of sialic acid in an alpha-2,6 linkage by CD22 ligands. In all cases, truncation of the side chain of sialic acids by mild periodate oxidation abolishes recognition by CD22Rg. Direct binding of CD22Rg to lymphoid cells also requires sialic acids and their side chains. Taken together, these observations indicate that CD22 is a sialic acid-binding lectin and may define a novel functional subset of immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules.",

    "abstract": "Summary We have visualized the relationship between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi in leaf cells of Nicotiana clevelandii by expression of two Golgi proteins fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). A fusion of the trans \u2010membrane domain (signal anchor sequence) of a rat sialyl transferase to GFP was targeted to the Golgi stacks. A second construct that expressed the Arabidopsis H/KDEL receptor homologue aERD2, fused to GFP, was targeted to both the Golgi apparatus and ER, allowing the relationship between these two organelles to be studied in living cells for the first time. The Golgi stacks were shown to move rapidly and extensively along the polygonal cortical ER network of leaf epidermal cells, without departing from the ER tubules. Co\u2010localization of F\u2010actin in the GFP\u2010expressing cells revealed an underlying actin cytoskeleton that matched precisely the architecture of the ER network, while treatment of cells with the inhibitors cytochalasin D and N\u2010ethylmaleimide revealed the dependency of Golgi movement on actin cables. These observations suggest that the leaf Golgi complex functions as a motile system of actin\u2010directed stacks whose function is to pick up products from a relatively stationary ER system. Also, we demonstrate for the first time in vivo brefeldin A\u2010induced retrograde transport of Golgi membrane protein to the ER.",

    "abstract": "There has been much interest and speculation about the potential of protoplast methods for genetic manipulation and crop improvement. For protoplasts to make a contribution to providing novel genetic variability, it is essential to be able to regenerate whole plants from them. Although there is often considerable excitement when plant regeneration from a species is first reported, from the point of view of using protoplasts to modify crops, this is but a first step. If protoplast methods, whether fusion, transformation or mutagenesis, are to become part of the plant breeders \"tool box\" it is essential to have systems that are efficient, reliable and defined sufficiently to enable easy transfer from one laboratory to another.",

    "abstract": "Although in vivo electroporation is currently an unfamiliar nonviral means of gene transfer, accounting for only about 1% of total studies related to in vivo gene transfer and gene therapy, it may be extensively used for experimental and therapeutic purposes in the near future. Like other nonviral methods, in vivo electroporation has a variety of advantages over viral vectors as: any types of cells and tissues in theory could become a target, handling is easy and quickly done within a matter of second, repeated administration of DNA is possible, no immunogenicity is expected, and there is no constraints on amounts and sizes of DNA to be used. Gene transfer efficiency of in vivo electroporation was found to be equivalent to or even superior to that of in vivo lipofection, gene gun and direct DNA injection methods. Although gene expression exerted is transient and foreign genes are likely to be present in an episomal form when transferred by in vivo electroporation, foreign gene products could be detected for more than 1 month depending on tissues and DNA constructs used. Gene expression generated by in vivo electroporation could be controlled to a certain extent in a tissue- or cell-specific manner, and be induced as intended. Perhaps better appraisal of in vivo electroporation as a nonviral gene transfer method should be brought forth in the future after more detailed analyses.",

    "title": "Cleavage of the Murine Leukemia Virus Transmembrane Env Protein by Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Protease: Transdominant Inhibition by Matrix Mutations",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We have identified mutations in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) matrix protein (MA) which block infectivity of virions pseudotyped with murine leukemia virus (MuLV) envelope (Env) glycoproteins without affecting infectivity conferred by HIV-1 Env or vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoproteins. This inhibition is very potent and displays a strong transdominant effect; infectivity is reduced more than 100-fold when wild-type and mutant molecular clones are cotransfected at a 1:1 ratio. This phenomenon is observed with both ecotropic and amphotropic MuLV Env. The MA mutations do not affect the incorporation of MuLV Env into virions. We demonstrate that in HIV-1 virions pseudotyped with MuLV Env, the HIV-1 protease (PR) efficiently catalyzes the cleavage of the p15(E) transmembrane (TM) protein to p12(E). Immunoprecipitation analysis of pseudotyped virions reveals that the mutant MA blocks this HIV-1 PR-mediated cleavage of MuLV TM. Furthermore, the transdominant inhibition exerted by the mutant MA on wild-type infectivity correlates with the relative level of p15(E) cleavage. Consistent with the hypothesis that abrogation of infectivity imposed by the mutant MA is due to inhibition of p15(E) cleavage, mutant virions are significantly more infectious when pseudotyped with a truncated p12(E) form of MuLV Env. These results indicate that HIV-1 Gag sequences can influence the viral PR-mediated processing of the MuLV TM Env protein p15(E). These findings have implications for the development of HIV-1-based retroviral vectors pseudotyped with MuLV Env, since p15(E) cleavage is essential for activating membrane fusion and virus infectivity.",

    "title": "Meiotic Transmission of an In Vitro\u2013Assembled Autonomous Maize Minichromosome",
    "abstract": "Autonomous chromosomes are generated in yeast (yeast artificial chromosomes) and human fibrosarcoma cells (human artificial chromosomes) by introducing purified DNA fragments that nucleate a kinetochore, replicate, and segregate to daughter cells. These autonomous minichromosomes are convenient for manipulating and delivering DNA segments containing multiple genes. In contrast, commercial production of transgenic crops relies on methods that integrate one or a few genes into host chromosomes; extensive screening to identify insertions with the desired expression level, copy number, structure, and genomic location; and long breeding programs to produce varieties that carry multiple transgenes. As a step toward improving transgenic crop production, we report the development of autonomous maize minichromosomes (MMCs). We constructed circular MMCs by combining DsRed and nptII marker genes with 7\u2013190 kb of genomic maize DNA fragments containing satellites, retroelements, and/or other repeats commonly found in centromeres and using particle bombardment to deliver these constructs into embryogenic maize tissue. We selected transformed cells, regenerated plants, and propagated their progeny for multiple generations in the absence of selection. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and segregation analysis demonstrated that autonomous MMCs can be mitotically and meiotically maintained. The MMC described here showed meiotic segregation ratios approaching Mendelian inheritance: 93% transmission as a disome (100% expected), 39% transmission as a monosome crossed to wild type (50% expected), and 59% transmission in self crosses (75% expected). The fluorescent DsRed reporter gene on the MMC was expressed through four generations, and Southern blot analysis indicated the encoded genes were intact. This novel approach for plant transformation can facilitate crop biotechnology by (i) combining several trait genes on a single DNA fragment, (ii) arranging genes in a defined sequence context for more consistent gene expression, and (iii) providing an independent linkage group that can be rapidly introgressed into various germplasms.",

    "abstract": "Aims: Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1 (VKORC1) is a critical participant in the production of active forms of reduced vitamin K and is required for modification of vitamin K\u2013dependent proteins. Homologues of VKORC1 (VKORH) exist throughout evolution, but in bacteria they appear to function in oxidative protein folding as well as quinone reduction. In the current study we explore two questions: Do VKORHs function in the mammalian vitamin K cycle? Is the pair of loop cysteines\u2014C43 and C51 in human VKORC1\u2014conserved in all VKORC1s, essential for the activity of vitamin K epoxide reduction? Results: We used our recently developed cell-based assay to compare the function of VKORHs to that of human VKORC1 in mammalian cells. We identified for the first time a VKORH (from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [Mt-VKORH]) that can function in the mammalian vitamin K cycle with vitamin K epoxide or vitamin K as substrate. Consistent with our previous in vitro results, the loop cysteines of human VKORC1 are not essential for its activity in vivo. Moreover, the corresponding loop cysteines of Mt-VKORH (C57 and C65), which are essential for its activity in disulfide bond formation during protein folding in Escherichia coli, are not required in the mammalian vitamin K cycle. Innovation and Conclusions: Our results indicate that VKORC1 in eukaryotes and Mt-VKORH in bacteria, that is, in their respective native environments, employ apparently different mechanisms for electron transfer. However, when Mt-VKORH is in the mammalian cell system, it employs a mechanism similar to that of VKORC1. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 16, 329\u2013338.",

Immunotherapy remains the only therapeutic modality that addresses the underlying mechanism, albeit by effects are still not fully understood. The approaches summarized in this chapter, alone or in combination, may yet allow one to reverse the atopic state. Meanwhile, other innovative DNA-based approaches are being developed, including the use of allergen DNA with or without CpG.

Cells from Cockayne syndrome patients with mutations in the XPG gene show approximately 2-fold reduced global repair of thymine glycol. Hence, I decided to investigate the molecular mechanism of the effect of XPG protein observed in vivo on thymine glycol removal by studying the interactions of XPG protein and human endonuclease III (HsNTH) protein in vitro and the effect of XPG protein on the activity of HsNTH protein on a substrate containing thymine glycol. The XPG protein stimulates the binding of HsNTH protein to its substrate and increases its glycosylase/AP lyase activity by a factor of approximately 2 through direct interaction between the two proteins. These results provide in vitro evidence for a second function of XPG protein in DNA repair and a mechanistic basis for its stimulatory activity on HsNTH protein.",

    "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a promising target for anticancer therapy because of its role in tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis, and tumor resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We have developed a low-molecular-weight EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), ZD1839 (Iressa(2) ). ZD1839, a substituted anilinoquinazoline, is a potent EGFR-TKI (IC(50) = 0.033 micro M) that selectively inhibits EGF-stimulated tumor cell growth (IC(50) = 0.054 micro M) and that blocks EGF-stimulated EGFR autophosphorylation in tumor cells. In studies with mice bearing a range of human tumor-derived xenografts, ZD1839 given p.o. once a day inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. The level of expression of EGFR did not determine xenograft tumor sensitivity to ZD1839. Long-term ZD1839 (>3 months) treatment of mice bearing A431 xenografts was well tolerated, and ZD1839 completely inhibited tumor growth and induced regression of established tumors. No drug-resistant tumors appeared during ZD1839 treatment, but some tumors regrew after drug withdrawal. These studies indicate the potential utility of ZD1839 in the treatment of many human tumors and indicate that continuous once-a-day p.o. dosing might be a suitable therapeutic regimen.",

A number of more advanced techniques are covered in this chapter. Since molecular weight plays such a critical role in polymeric materials' performance, rheological techniques and instrumentations capable of direct measurement of polymer's molecular weight and molecular weight distribution are discussed. Also, since molecular relaxations frequently govern engineering properties of biological responses, both the dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and dielectric spectroscopy are presented. In this regard, the widely used thermal analysis technique, primarily that of the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), provides a wealth of fundamental information on the polymer system at hand. In many cases the reliability of devices often depends on fracture and failure phenomenon. A thorough and vigorous discussion on fracture mechanics, fatigue phenomenon and reliability prediction provides some basic tools that can be applied in this area. Finally, a brief discussion on the shelf life aspect of product performance is given.",
