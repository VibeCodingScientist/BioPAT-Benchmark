    "abstract": "The present invention provides HIV-derived lentivectors which are safe, highly efficient, and very potent for expressing transgenes for human gene therapy, especially, in human hematopoietic progenitor cells as well as in all other blood cell derivatives. The lentiviral vectors comprise a self-inactivating configuration for biosafety and promoters such as the EF1\u03b1 promoter as one example. Additional promoters are also described. The vectors can also comprise additional transcription enhancing elements such as the wood chuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element. These vectors therefore provide useful tools for genetic treatments such as inherited and acquired lympho-hematological disorders, gene-therapies for cancers especially the hematological cancers, as well as for the study of hematopoiesis via lentivector-mediated modification of human HSCs.",

Though massively parallel sequencing instruments are in principle well-suited to this task, the error rates in such instruments are generally too high to allow confident identification of rare variants. We here describe an approach that can substantially increase the sensitivity of massively parallel sequencing instruments for this purpose. One example of this approach, called \u201cSafe-SeqS\u201d for (Safe-Sequencing System) includes (i) assignment of a unique identifier (UID) to each template molecule; (ii) amplification of each uniquely tagged template molecule to create UID-families; and (iii) redundant sequencing of the amplification products. PCR fragments with the same UID are truly mutant (\u201csuper-mutants\u201d) if \u226595% of them contain the identical mutation. We illustrate the utility of this approach for determining the fidelity of a polymerase, the accuracy of oligonucleotides synthesized in vitro, and the prevalence of mutations in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of normal cells.",

A user request is received, the user request including at least a speech input received from a user. In response to the user request, (1) an echo of the speech input based on a textual interpretation of the speech input, and (2) a paraphrase of the user request based at least in part on a respective semantic interpretation of the speech input are presented to the user.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to the treatment of EGFR-mediated disease, particularly cancer by inhibiting or blocking EGFR and src in combination or simultaneously. The invention relates to treatment, prevention, or modulation of cancer, particularly EGFR-mediated disease, with one or more EGFR modulator and src inhibitor in combination. The invention further relates to the treatment of cancer with anti-EGFR antibodies and src inhibitors. Methods and compositions for treatment of cancer with the antibody anti-EGFR mAb806 in combination or series with a src inhibitor or src inhibitors are described.",
